# Story: Implement Billing Tab with Flutter-to-Kotlin Navigation

## Description

Implement the "Billing" tab as a Flutter view with navigation to a Kotlin detail page, demonstrating
Flutter-to-Kotlin navigation with deep linking capabilities.

## Requirements

- Implement Billing tab as a Flutter view
- Create navigation to a Kotlin Item Detail Page for a bill
- Implement deep linking capabilities to the bill detail page
- Configure proper backstack behavior when navigating between Flutter and Kotlin

## Technical Tasks

- [ ] Create the main Billing tab UI in Flutter
- [ ] Implement list of bills with selectable items
- [ ] Create Kotlin bill detail page
- [ ] Implement navigation from Flutter billing list to Kotlin bill detail
- [ ] Set up deep link handling for direct navigation to bill detail
- [ ] Configure proper backstack behavior when returning from bill detail
- [ ] Add appropriate transition animations between views
- [ ] Implement state preservation when returning to billing list

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Billing tab displays correctly with list of bills
- [ ] Selecting a bill navigates to a Kotlin detail view
- [ ] Deep links correctly navigate directly to bill detail page
- [ ] Back button works correctly when navigating from bill detail to billing list
- [ ] State is preserved when navigating back to billing list
- [ ] No visual glitches during transitions

## Dependencies

- Story 1: Setup Base Hybrid App Infrastructure

## Notes

This story demonstrates Flutter-to-Kotlin navigation with deep linking support. Special attention
should be paid to handling the backstack correctly when navigating from Flutter to Kotlin and back.

- **Likelihood of Frustration:** 6/10
- **Likelihood of Manual Steps:** 8/10

### Time Estimate

- **Estimated Hours:** 10-12 hours

### Notes

This story presents several complex challenges:

1. Implementing navigation from Flutter to Kotlin views requires custom platform channel
   implementation
2. Deep linking support requires careful coordination between Android's intent system and Flutter's
   navigation
3. Preserving state when navigating back to Flutter from Kotlin requires special attention

The most challenging aspect will likely be setting up the deep linking infrastructure that allows
direct navigation to a specific bill detail page. This requires:

- Custom URI scheme registration in the Android manifest
- Intent handling in the Kotlin host
- State management to ensure the correct bill is displayed

Consider using the Flutter plugin "uni_links" to help with deep link handling, but be prepared for
custom implementation to handle the Kotlin-Flutter boundary.
