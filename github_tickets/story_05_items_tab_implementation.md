# Story: Implement Items Tab with ListView and Deep Linking

## Summary (TLDR)

**Create a Flutter ListView that navigates to detail pages with deep linking support.**

* **Key Features**:
    * Flutter implementation of scrollable item list
    * Item detail page in Flutter
    * **Special handling for Item7** with visual distinction
    * **Deep linking** directly to Item7 detail page
* **Technical Focus**:
    * List state preservation when navigating back
    * Implementing deep linking within Flutter views
* **Time Estimate**: 5-7 hours

## Description

Implement the "Items" tab as a Flutter ListView with navigation to a detail page for Item7,
supporting deep linking capabilities.

## Requirements

- Implement Items tab as a Flutter ListView
- Create Item Detail page in Flutter
- Configure special behavior for Item7 that links to the detail page
- Implement deep linking capabilities to the Item7 detail page
- Ensure proper list state preservation when navigating back

## Technical Tasks

- [ ] Create the Flutter Items tab with ListView implementation
- [ ] Implement multiple sample items in the list (at least 10)
- [ ] Create Flutter Item Detail page with dynamic content based on selected item
- [ ] Configure special UI treatment for Item7 in the list
- [ ] Implement navigation from list to detail page
- [ ] Set up deep linking infrastructure for direct navigation to Item7 detail
- [ ] Add transition animations between list and detail views
- [ ] Ensure scroll position and selection state are preserved when returning to list

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Items tab displays a list of at least 10 items
- [ ] Item7 has special visual treatment in the list
- [ ] Tapping any item navigates to its detail page
- [ ] Deep link correctly navigates directly to Item7 detail page
- [ ] Back button from detail page returns to items list with preserved state
- [ ] List scroll position is maintained when returning from detail page
- [ ] No visual glitches during transitions

## Dependencies

- Story 1: Setup Base Hybrid App Infrastructure

## Notes

This story focuses on demonstrating Flutter's ListView capabilities with deep linking support. The
implementation should follow Flutter best practices for list management and state preservation.

## AI Analysis

### Development Assistance Metrics

- **LOE with Firebender using Claude Sonnet 3.7:** Medium
- **LOE with Firebender using Gemini 2.5 Pro:** Medium-Low

### Project Metrics (Scale 1-10)

- **Likelihood of Success:** 9/10
- **Likelihood of Frustration:** 3/10
- **Likelihood of Manual Steps:** 5/10

### Time Estimate

- **Estimated Hours:** 5-7 hours

### Notes

This story is relatively straightforward as it stays within the Flutter ecosystem (no
cross-technology navigation). The main challenges will be:

1. Setting up the deep linking infrastructure specifically for Item7
2. Ensuring proper state preservation when navigating back to the list
3. Implementing special visual treatment for Item7 that makes it stand out

Flutter's built-in Navigator should handle most of the navigation requirements, but deep linking
will require additional setup to coordinate with the Android host application.

Consider using Flutter packages like `go_router` or `auto_route` to simplify the navigation and deep
linking implementation. The ListView should use efficient widgets like `ListView.builder` for
performance optimization.
