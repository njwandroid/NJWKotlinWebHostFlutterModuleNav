# Story: Implement Deep Linking and Integration Testing

## Description

Implement comprehensive deep linking infrastructure across the application and create integration
tests to verify proper navigation behavior across all tabs and views.

## Requirements

- Implement deep link handlers in the Android host
- Configure Flutter to respond to deep links
- Create test cases for direct navigation to specific screens
- Implement integration tests for complex navigation flows
- Document deep link URL formats and navigation patterns

## Technical Tasks

- [ ] Set up URI scheme and intent filters in Android manifest
- [ ] Create deep link handlers in the Android host application
- [ ] Configure Flutter to process deep links via platform channels
- [ ] Implement deep linking to specific screens:
    - [ ] Bill detail page (Kotlin)
    - [ ] Item7 detail page (Flutter)
    - [ ] ThTif tab and its inner views
- [ ] Create integration tests for all navigation patterns
- [ ] Test edge cases like backgrounding app during navigation
- [ ] Document all deep link formats and usage
- [ ] Create a demo/test app to launch deep links

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Deep links correctly navigate to all target screens
- [ ] Integration tests verify all navigation paths work correctly
- [ ] Back button behavior is consistent across all navigation flows
- [ ] State preservation works correctly when navigating via deep links
- [ ] Documentation clearly explains all deep link formats and usage
- [ ] Edge cases like app backgrounding and rotation are handled properly

## Dependencies

- Story 1: Setup Base Hybrid App Infrastructure
- Story 2: Implement My Tab with Mixed-Technology Navigation
- Story 3: Implement Billing Tab with Flutter-to-Kotlin Navigation
- Story 4: Implement Dashboard Tab with Request Service Navigation
- Story 5: Implement Items Tab with ListView and Deep Linking
- Story 6: Implement ThTif Tab with Complex Cross-Technology Navigation

## Notes

This story integrates and validates the navigation behaviors implemented in previous stories,
ensuring that all navigation paths work correctly and consistently.

### Notes

This integration story is critical to ensure the overall application functions correctly. The main
challenges will be:

1. Setting up a comprehensive deep linking system that works across both Kotlin and Flutter
2. Creating robust integration tests that can verify complex navigation paths
3. Handling edge cases like app backgrounding during navigation

Deep linking in hybrid apps requires careful coordination between the host application's URI
handling and Flutter's navigation system. While Flutter provides packages like `uni_links` to help
with this, the cross-technology nature of this application will require custom integration work.

The integration tests should verify all possible navigation paths, with special attention to:

1. Navigation between different technology stacks (Kotlin to Flutter and vice versa)
2. Proper backstack behavior in complex navigation sequences
3. State preservation when returning to previous screens
4. Handling of edge cases like device rotation and backgrounding

This story is particularly well-suited for AI assistance to generate test cases and documentation.
