# Story: Configure Flutter Project for Web Platform

## Summary (TLDR)

**Set up Flutter web support in the project with minimal modifications.**

* **Key Tasks**:
    * Enable Flutter web support with proper configurations
    * Set up web entry points and asset handling
    * Configure platform detection for conditional code
    * Test rendering in multiple browsers
* **Technical Focus**:
    * Making Flutter work in browsers without disrupting mobile functionality
    * Configuring optimal web renderer (HTML vs CanvasKit)
* **Time Estimate**: 6-8 hours

## Description

Configure the existing Flutter module for web platform support, ensuring that the core application
can run in a web browser with minimal modifications. This foundational story sets up the web
infrastructure needed for subsequent tasks.

## Requirements

- Enable Flutter web support in the project
- Configure web-specific assets and dependencies
- Set up proper entry points for web deployment
- Handle platform detection for conditional code execution
- Test basic Flutter rendering in browser environment

## Technical Tasks

- [ ] Run `flutter config --enable-web` to enable web support
- [ ] Create web-specific entry point (main_web.dart if needed)
- [ ] Configure web/index.html template with appropriate meta tags and scripts
- [ ] Set up web-specific assets in web/ directory
- [ ] Implement platform detection helpers for conditional code
- [ ] Configure web renderers (HTML vs CanvasKit) based on performance needs
- [ ] Test basic widget rendering in Chrome and other browsers

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Flutter app can be built for web platform with `flutter build web`
- [ ] App can be run locally using `flutter run -d chrome`
- [ ] Basic UI renders correctly in web browsers
- [ ] Platform detection correctly identifies web platform
- [ ] Web-specific assets load correctly
- [ ] No critical rendering issues in major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## Dependencies

- Completion of mobile navigation infrastructure

## Notes

This story focuses only on the technical configuration for web support and does not include adapting
the navigation patterns, which will be addressed in a subsequent story. The goal is to have a
working web build that displays correctly in browsers.

### Notes

For a Flutter developer with minimal web knowledge, the main challenges will be:

1. Understanding web-specific configuration in Flutter
2. Handling platform detection correctly
3. Configuring the web renderer appropriately

Flutter abstracts much of the web complexity, so the core configuration is relatively
straightforward. The developer should focus on:

- Proper meta tag configuration in index.html for responsive design
- Testing on multiple browsers, not just Chrome
- Understanding the tradeoffs between HTML and CanvasKit renderers

Few gotchas to be aware of:

- Some Flutter plugins may not support web
- Performance characteristics differ significantly between mobile and web
- Font loading may require additional configuration

Most of this work involves configuration rather than coding, making it approachable even with
limited web experience.
