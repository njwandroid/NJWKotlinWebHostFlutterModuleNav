# EPIC: Future Vision and Project Evolution

## Overview

This epic serves as a placeholder for future refinements, enhancements, and strategic directions
after the completion of Milestones 1 and 2. The ideas captured here represent potential paths for
evolving the project beyond its initial implementation goals.

## Potential Areas for Future Development

### 1. Project Refinement

- Performance optimization across all platforms
- Memory usage improvements and leak prevention
- Accessibility compliance and enhancements
- Internationalization and localization support
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Analytics integration for usage insights

### 2. Usage Expansion

- Additional platform support (desktop, embedded)
- Integration with more native platform features
- Advanced navigation patterns and animations
- State management improvements and alternatives
- Enhanced styling and theming capabilities
- Dark mode and dynamic theming support

### 3. Distribution Improvements

- Streamlined CI/CD pipeline for all platforms
- Automated release processes
- Version migration strategies
- A/B testing infrastructure
- Feature flag implementation
- Crash reporting and monitoring solutions

### 4. Template Creation

- Extract reusable patterns into project templates
- Create starter kits for different use cases
- Develop plugin architecture for extensibility
- Build code generation tools for common patterns
- Establish best practices documentation
- Develop training materials and workshops

## Success Metrics

To be defined based on the specific direction chosen from the above areas. Each initiative should
consider:

- Developer productivity impact
- User experience improvements
- Performance benchmarks
- Adoption metrics
- Maintainability indicators
- Learning curve considerations

## Timeline Considerations

The work captured in this epic is intentionally not scheduled and will be prioritized after the
successful completion and evaluation of Milestones 1 and 2.

## Notes

This document should be revisited and refined after the completion of Milestone 2 to incorporate
learnings and insights gained during the initial implementation phases.
