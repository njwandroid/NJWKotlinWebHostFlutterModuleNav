# ISSUE: Integrate Navigation Patterns with Existing Kotlin Application

## Description

Apply the navigation patterns, deep linking structure, and Flutter integration techniques developed
in this project to an existing non-trivial Kotlin Android application. This will demonstrate the
reusability of our architecture and provide insights into migration strategies for established
applications.

## Business Value

- Validate the reusability of our architectural patterns in real-world scenarios
- Establish migration paths for existing Kotlin applications to incorporate Flutter
- Document integration challenges and solutions for the broader developer community
- Demonstrate incremental adoption strategy rather than full rewrites

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Select an appropriate existing open-source Kotlin application with complex navigation
2. Create a forked version that integrates our Flutter navigation patterns
3. Implement deep linking between native Kotlin screens and new Flutter screens
4. Preserve existing functionality while enhancing with Flutter components
5. Ensure proper backstack behavior across the hybrid navigation structure
6. Document the integration process with emphasis on challenges and solutions
7. Provide performance comparisons between original and hybrid implementation
8. Create a technical blog post or presentation about the integration experience

## Technical Approach

- Start with adding Flutter as a dependency to the existing application
- Identify ideal entry points where Flutter screens would provide value
- Apply the FlutterFragment or FlutterActivity pattern as appropriate
- Implement deep link handlers for seamless navigation
- Ensure state preservation during navigation between native and Flutter
- Apply lessons learned from previous milestones regarding navigation architecture

## Dependencies

- Completion of Milestone 1 and 2
- Access to an appropriate open-source Kotlin application for modification

## Estimation

- Complexity: High
- Effort: 2-3 weeks
- Priority: Medium

## Additional Notes

This issue serves as a practical application of the project's concepts to real-world scenarios and
will provide valuable insights into the adoption strategies for the broader developer community.
Documentation of the process is as important as the technical implementation.
