# ISSUE: Enhance Existing Web Application with Flutter Web and WASM

## Description

Apply the Flutter web navigation techniques and WASM implementation developed in this project to
enhance an existing non-trivial web application. This exploration will focus on incrementally
integrating Flutter components and WASM modules into a traditional web application while maintaining
its core functionality and user experience.

## Business Value

- Demonstrate practical migration strategies for existing web applications to Flutter web
- Showcase performance benefits of WASM implementation in real-world scenarios
- Provide a roadmap for gradual modernization of legacy web applications
- Create reference architecture for hybrid web applications (traditional + Flutter + WASM)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Select an appropriate existing open-source web application with complex UI requirements
2. Identify components suitable for Flutter web and WASM optimization
3. Create a forked version that embeds Flutter web components in strategic locations
4. Implement at least one computationally intensive feature using WASM
5. Ensure seamless navigation between traditional web views and Flutter components
6. Maintain visual consistency between original and Flutter components
7. Document integration architecture with emphasis on communication patterns
8. Provide performance benchmarks comparing original implementation to Flutter/WASM versions
9. Create a technical tutorial about the integration approach

## Technical Approach

- Analyze an existing web application for integration opportunities
- Use Flutter web in embedded mode for targeted component replacement
- Implement appropriate state synchronization between Flutter and the host application
- Apply WASM for performance-critical operations
- Ensure deep linking works properly across the hybrid architecture
- Leverage lessons learned from the web deployment work in Milestone 2

## Dependencies

- Completion of Milestone 1 and 2
- Particularly dependent on the WASM implementation from Milestone 2
- Access to an appropriate open-source web application for modification

## Estimation

- Complexity: Very High
- Effort: 3-4 weeks
- Priority: Medium

## Additional Notes

This issue represents an advanced application of the project's concepts, focusing on real-world
integration challenges in existing web ecosystems. The knowledge gained will be particularly
valuable for organizations looking to modernize their web presence incrementally rather than through
complete rewrites.
