# STORY: WASM Implementation and Documentation

## Description

Implement WebAssembly (WASM) support for the Flutter application to enhance web performance and
enable native-like functionality in the browser environment. This story includes developing WASM
modules, integrating them with the Flutter web application, and providing comprehensive
documentation and demonstration materials.

## Business Value

- Improved web application performance through WASM implementation
- Enhanced capabilities for web-based deployment
- Better user experience in browser environments
- Demonstration of cutting-edge web technology integration with Flutter

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Implement at least one feature using WASM that demonstrates performance benefits
2. Create integration layer between Flutter web and WASM modules
3. Develop a simple demo showcasing WASM functionality
4. Document the implementation process, benefits, and usage guidelines
5. Measure and document performance improvements compared to JavaScript implementation
6. Create screenshots and basic video demonstration of the WASM integration
7. Add appropriate tests to verify WASM functionality

## Technical Notes

- Will require expertise in both C/C++ (or Rust) and Flutter web development
- May need custom build scripts to compile WASM modules
- Should verify compatibility across major browsers
- Consider using Flutter's FFI for communication with WASM modules
- Explore potential use of wasm_interop package for Flutter-WASM communication

## Dependencies

- Milestone 1 web implementation must be complete
- story_web_01_platform_configuration.md
- story_web_02_navigation_adaptation.md

## Estimation

- Complexity: High
- Effort: 5-7 days
- Priority: Medium

## Documentation Requirements

- Implementation approach and architecture
- Build process documentation
- Integration guide for developers
- Performance benchmarks and comparisons
- Demo instructions with screenshots and code examples
- Known limitations and future improvement areas
