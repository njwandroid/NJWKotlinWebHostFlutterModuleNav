# ISSUE 5: JNIgen - Generate Bindings and Call from Dart

## Description

Complete the JNIgen integration by generating Dart bindings for the Kotlin functions created
earlier, and call these functions from the Flutter UI to demonstrate the complete bridge between
Dart and Kotlin.

## Time Allocation

- 40 minutes

## Objectives

- Generate Dart bindings for Kotlin functions using JNIgen
- Integrate the generated bindings into the Flutter application
- Demonstrate calling Kotlin code from Flutter UI

## Tasks

1. Generate Dart bindings using JNIgen (10 min)
    - Run JNIgen to generate bindings for the Kotlin function
    - Verify generated Dart files
    - Move generated files to appropriate location in project if needed

2. Call the Kotlin function from Flutter (20 min)
    - Import the generated Dart bindings
    - Create a UI component (e.g., button) to trigger the function call
    - Display the result from the Kotlin function in a Text widget
    - Handle any potential errors gracefully

3. Test and verify the integration (10 min)
    - Verify the function call works end-to-end
    - Test with different inputs if applicable
    - Document any issues encountered

## Deliverables

- Generated Dart bindings for the Kotlin function
- Flutter UI component that calls the Kotlin function
- Working demonstration of Kotlin-Flutter integration
- Documentation of the implementation approach

## Acceptance Criteria

1. JNIgen successfully generates Dart bindings for the Kotlin function
2. Flutter UI can call the Kotlin function and display the result
3. Integration works consistently across multiple calls
4. Implementation follows best practices for both Kotlin and Flutter
5. Code is clean, well-documented, and maintainable

## Dependencies

- Completion of issues #1, #2, #3, and #4
- Kotlin implementation from previous work
- Understanding of JNIgen configuration and usage
