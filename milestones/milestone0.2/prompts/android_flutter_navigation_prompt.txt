I need to implement bidirectional navigation between native Android and Flutter within the next 70 minutes. Yesterday I set up basic Flutter navigation scaffolding with placeholder screens (HomeScreen, NativeDemoScreen, DeepLinkTargetScreen).

Please help me with the following:

1. Create a simple native Android Activity that can launch into my Flutter application, specifically to the NativeDemoScreen route. Include:
   - The Activity implementation
   - Any necessary AndroidManifest.xml changes
   - Code to pass parameters if possible

2. Set up communication from Flutter back to native Android:
   - Implement a MethodChannel in the Flutter app
   - Add the corresponding platform-specific code in Android
   - Create a button on the NativeDemoScreen that calls a simple native action (e.g., showing a Toast)

3. Ensure back button behavior works correctly:
   - Back button should navigate from Flutter to the native Activity
   - State should be preserved when navigating back and forth

Please provide the complete implementation for both the Android (Kotlin) and Flutter (Dart) sides. Include error handling and best practices. The goal is a clean demo showing bidirectional communication between native and Flutter.
