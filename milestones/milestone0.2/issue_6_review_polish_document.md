# ISSUE 6: Review, Polish MVDs & Document Next Steps

## Description

Consolidate the work completed across all Minimum Viable Demos (MVDs) - Maestro testing, Add2App,
navigation, deep links, and JNIgen. Ensure all implementations are runnable, capture key talking
points for demos, and document future enhancement opportunities.

## Time Allocation

- 40 minutes

## Objectives

- Verify all MVDs are functioning correctly
- Document key talking points for each demo
- Capture ideas for future improvements and polish

## Tasks

1. Review all MVDs (15 min)
    - Run the Maestro tests to verify they still pass
    - Test the Add2App bottom navigation integration
    - Test the navigation flows (native, deep links, web)
    - Verify the JNIgen integration works correctly
    - Fix any minor issues encountered

2. Document key demo talking points (15 min)
    - For each MVD, create a list of key points to highlight in a demo
    - Capture screenshots or recordings of key functionality
    - Document the most interesting/challenging aspects of each implementation

3. Create Future Polish Blueprint (10 min)
    - For each MVD, document ideas for future enhancements
    - Capture potential blog post or training material ideas
    - Note any technical debt or refactoring opportunities
    - Document open questions or areas for further exploration

## Deliverables

- Verified working MVDs for all focus areas
- Demo script with key talking points for each MVD
- "Future Polish & Content Blueprint" document with enhancement ideas
- PR with documentation and any minor fixes

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All MVDs are verified to be working correctly
2. Key demo points are documented for each MVD
3. Future enhancement opportunities are captured
4. Documentation is clear, concise, and actionable

## Dependencies

- Successful completion of issues #1 through #5
