I need to implement a demo of Flutter's Add2App functionality in an Android application within 80 minutes. Specifically, I want to create a native Android app with a bottom navigation bar where some tabs display native content and others display Flutter content.

Please help me with the following:

1. Set up a native Android project with BottomNavigationView:
   - What's the most efficient way to create a basic Android app with bottom navigation?
   - How should I structure the project to accommodate Flutter modules?
   - Code for a simple BottomNavigationView with 4 tabs (2 native, 2 Flutter)

2. Create Flutter modules for embedding:
   - Steps to create a Flutter module project
   - How to design 2 simple but distinct Flutter screens
   - Any special configuration needed for Add2App compatibility

3. Integrate Flutter modules into my native Android app:
   - Step-by-step integration process
   - How to load Flutter views into specific navigation tabs
   - Handling lifecycle events properly
   - Ensuring smooth navigation between native and Flutter tabs

4. Implement communication between native Android and Flutter:
   - Setting up MethodChannel for bidirectional communication
   - Example of passing data from Android to Flutter
   - Example of triggering native functionality from Flutter
   - Best practices for state synchronization

I need code that is clean, well-structured, and follows current best practices for both Android and Flutter development. The goal is a working demo that showcases the potential of incrementally adopting Flutter in existing Android apps.
