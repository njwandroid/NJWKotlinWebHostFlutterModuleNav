I need help creating a comprehensive Maestro test suite for my cross-platform application. I have 40 minutes to create tests that demonstrate Maestro's ability to work with Flutter, native Android, and web platforms.

Please help me with the following:

1. Set up a basic Flutter "Hello World" application with native Android elements:
   - What minimal code do I need for a Flutter app that includes some native Android components?
   - How can I structure the app to make it testable with Maestro across platforms?

2. Create Maestro flow files for testing:
   - A flow that tests Flutter UI components
   - A flow that tests native Android components
   - A flow that tests the app when running on web

3. Each flow should:
   - Launch the app
   - Verify appropriate UI elements are visible
   - Perform some basic interactions
   - Take screenshots for verification

4. Provide commands to run these tests on:
   - Android device/emulator
   - Web browser

I need a solution that demonstrates cross-platform testing capabilities within this 40-minute window. Include any common pitfalls I should avoid when testing across platforms with Maestro.
