I need help creating a minimal viable Maestro test for my Flutter application. I have 12 minutes to create a simple test that proves Maestro can run and interact with my app.

Please help me with the following:

1. Create a basic Maestro flow YAML file that I can place in my maestro/flows directory.
2. The flow should:
   - Launch my app
   - Wait for it to be visible
   - Assert that a specific text element is visible (let's use "Welcome" or the app's main title)
   - Take a screenshot for verification

My app has a simple home screen with a title at the top. I need the most minimal YAML file that will work, along with the commands to execute it and capture the screenshot.

If there are any common pitfalls with Maestro, please mention those as well so I can avoid them in this quick implementation.
