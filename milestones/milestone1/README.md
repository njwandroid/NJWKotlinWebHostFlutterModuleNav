# Milestone 1: Timeboxed Demo Plan - Core Features

This milestone focuses on implementing the core features outlined in the timeboxed demo plan with a
7-hour focused effort. The primary areas of focus are:

1. Navigation and backstack management (Android & Web)
2. Deep linking implementation
3. Kotlin/Flutter integration
4. JNIgen bridge for native API calls
5. Basic Maestro testing

## Key Deliverables

- Working navigation between native Android and Flutter
- Functioning deep links to Flutter screens
- Basic web navigation adaptation
- JNIgen integration for Kotlin-Dart communication
- Simple Maestro UI test with screenshots

## Success Criteria

- All PRs include screenshots of working functionality
- Basic presentable material for each feature area
- Core navigation patterns between Android native code and Flutter
- Essential deep linking functionality
- Minimal JNIgen example with Kotlin API calls working
- Web version running with basic navigation
