# Project Milestones

This directory contains the project milestones for the Flutter Navigation Bar Application project,
organized to support structured, incremental development.

## Milestone Structure

### [Milestone 0.1: Day 1 - 2 Hour Quick Start](./milestone0.1/README.md)

Milestone 0.1 focuses on the first 2 hours of the timeboxed demo plan, covering:

- Maestro minimal viable test implementation
- JNIgen Kotlin side setup
- Flutter navigation scaffolding

### [Milestone 0.2: Day 2 - 5 Hour Implementation](./milestone0.2/README.md)

Milestone 0.2 completes the timeboxed demo plan with the remaining 5 hours, focusing on:

- Android Native <-> Flutter Navigation implementation
- Deep Links and Web preview
- JNIgen Dart bindings and integration
- Review and polish of all minimum viable demos (MVDs)

### [Milestone 1: Timeboxed Demo Plan - Core Features](./milestone1/README.md)

Milestone 1 focuses on implementing the core features outlined in the timeboxed demo plan with a
7-hour focused effort. This includes basic navigation patterns, deep linking, Kotlin/Flutter
integration, JNIgen, and initial Maestro testing.

Key areas:
- Navigation and backstack management (Android & Web)
- Deep linking implementation
- Kotlin/Flutter integration
- JNIgen bridge for native API calls
- Basic Maestro testing

### [Milestone 2: Extended Features & Capabilities](./milestone2/README.md)

Milestone 2 builds upon the core foundation established in Milestone 1, focusing on feature
completeness, platform expansion, and improved testing capabilities. This includes all tab
implementations, iOS integration, advanced testing, and WASM implementation.

Key areas:
- Complete tab implementation
- iOS navigation integration
- Enhanced platform communication
- Advanced Maestro testing with CI integration
- Web deployment and documentation
- WASM modifications and demonstration

### [Milestone 3: Future Vision](./milestone3/future_vision_epic.md)

Milestone 3 serves as a placeholder for future refinements, enhancements, and strategic directions
after the completion of Milestones 1 and 2. This includes ideas for project refinement, usage
expansion, distribution improvements, and template creation.

## Development Approach

The milestones are designed to be implemented sequentially:

1. **Milestone 0.1 & 0.2**: The immediate timeboxed 7-hour demo plan divided into two days
2. **Milestone 1**: Focus on core functionality with minimal viable demonstrations
3. **Milestone 2**: Complete feature implementation and expand platform support
4. **Milestone 3**: Refine, optimize, and prepare for wider adoption

Each issue in the milestones should include PRs, screenshots, and basic presentable material to
demonstrate functionality.
