# Temporary DITL - Story 03: Billing Tab Implementation

**Session Started**: 9:01pm  
**Story**: Implement Billing Tab with Flutter-to-Kotlin Navigation

This file contains temporary DITL notes for implementing the Billing tab story. Please ensure all
items in
`temporary_files/before_commit.md` are addressed before committing.

## Story Requirements Summary

- ✨ **Flutter Billing Tab**: Billing tab directly shows Flutter bills list (no TF button)
- 🔗 **Flutter→Kotlin Navigation**: Navigate from Flutter to native Kotlin detail page
- ↩️ **Backstack Management**: Proper navigation flow between Flutter and Kotlin
- 💾 **State Preservation**: Maintain state when returning to Flutter list
- 🎯 **STRETCH GOAL**: 🌐 Deep Linking (only after core functionality is 100% complete)

## Current Session Tasks Progress

### ✅ Completed Items

- ✅ **DITL File Created**: `ditl/temporary_ditl_story_03.md` initialized at 9:01pm
- ✅ **AI Log Setup**: `11_ai_interactions_log.md` created
- ✅ **Plan Adjustment**: Deep links moved to stretch goal (9:05pm)
- ✅ **UX Improvement**: Updated approach to have Billing tab directly show Flutter bills
- ✅ **Test Updated**: Modified Maestro test for direct billing tab navigation
- ✅ **Documentation Updated**: Updated GitHub issue with improved UX flow
- ✅ **Flutter Animation Removed**: Spinning text animation removed per user request
- ✅ **Flutter Bills UI**: Created bills list in `../njw_flutter_navigation_demo/lib/main.dart`
- ✅ **Kotlin Detail Activity**: Created `BillDetailActivity.kt` with Material 3 UI
- ✅ **AndroidManifest**: Added BillDetailActivity registration
- ✅ **Maestro Test Ready**: Core test created expecting direct Billing tab → Flutter bills flow

### 🔄 Current Blocker

- 🚫 **Flutter Integration Issue**: Build fails - missing
  `../njw_flutter_navigation_demo/.android/include_flutter.groovy`
- 🚫 **Import Errors**: MainActivity.kt missing Flutter imports (FlutterEngine, MethodChannel)
- 🚫 **Hybrid App Setup**: Need to properly configure Flutter module for Android integration

### 📋 Immediate Next Steps (Critical)

1. **Fix Flutter Module Setup**:
    - Run `flutter create --template=module .` in Flutter directory if needed
    - Ensure `.android/include_flutter.groovy` file exists
    - Verify Flutter module is properly configured for hybrid app

2. **Fix MainActivity Imports**:
    - Add missing Flutter imports: `FlutterEngine`, `MethodChannel`, `FlutterActivity`
    - Resolve platform channel setup for bill detail navigation
    - Fix LaunchedEffect to properly launch Flutter activity on Billing tap

3. **Test & Fix Cycle**:
    - Build: `./gradlew installDebug`
    - Run failing test: `maestro test maestro/flows/billing_tab_core.yaml`
    - Fix issues until test passes

### ⚠️ Items to Watch For

- ⚠️ **Platform Channel Setup**: Ensure proper communication between Flutter and Kotlin
- ⚠️ **State Management**: Test state preservation during navigation
- ⚠️ **Backstack Behavior**: Ensure back button works correctly
- ⚠️ **Direct Tab Integration**: Billing tab must directly show Flutter view (no TF button)
- ⚠️ **Flutter Module**: Hybrid app integration must work before proceeding

### 🎯 Core Success Criteria (Must Pass Before Stretch Goal)

- [ ] **BUILD WORKING**: App builds and installs successfully
- [ ] Billing tab directly displays Flutter bills list (no TF button needed)
- [ ] Bill list shows sample bills: Electric ($120.50), Water ($45.25), Internet ($89.99)
- [ ] Selecting bill navigates to Kotlin detail view with correct data
- [ ] Back button navigates correctly from detail to bills list
- [ ] State preserved when returning to billing list
- [ ] No visual glitches during transitions
- [ ] All core Maestro tests pass

### 🌟 Stretch Goal Success Criteria (Only after core is 100% done)

- [ ] Deep links work for direct bill detail access
- [ ] Deep link Maestro tests pass

### 📄 Handoff Context

**LLM Prompt Created**: `llm_prompt.txt` contains full context for continuation  
**Current Status**: Ready for Flutter integration fix and TDD completion  
**Physical Device**: Connected and ready for testing
