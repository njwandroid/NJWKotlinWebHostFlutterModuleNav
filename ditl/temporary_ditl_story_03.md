# Temporary DITL - Story 03: Billing Tab Implementation

**Session Started**: 9:01pm  
**Session Completed**: 9:44pm  
**Story**: Implement Billing Tab with Flutter-to-Kotlin Navigation

This file contains temporary DITL notes for implementing the Billing tab story. Please ensure all
items in
`temporary_files/before_commit.md` are addressed before committing.

## Story Requirements Summary

- ✨ **Flutter Billing Tab**: Billing tab directly shows Flutter bills list (no TF button)
- 🔗 **Flutter→Kotlin Navigation**: Navigate from Flutter to native Kotlin detail page
- ↩️ **Backstack Management**: Proper navigation flow between Flutter and Kotlin
- 💾 **State Preservation**: Maintain state when returning to Flutter list
- 🎯 **STRETCH GOAL**: 🌐 Deep Linking (only after core functionality is 100% complete)

## Final Session Results

### ✅ Successfully Completed (MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS)

- ✅ **DITL File Created**: `ditl/temporary_ditl_story_03.md` initialized at 9:01pm
- ✅ **AI Log Setup**: `11_ai_interactions_log.md` created and maintained
