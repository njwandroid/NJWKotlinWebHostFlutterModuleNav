Sonnet\u0027s perspective, here are strategies for effectively utilizing AI systems for development tasks:\\n\\n### Strengths of Claude 3.7 Sonnet\\n- **Code Understanding**: Excels at comprehending complex codebases and multi-file relationships\\n- **Contextual Reasoning**: Strong ability to maintain context across long conversations\\n- **Technical Documentation**: Produces detailed, well-structured technical documentation\\n- **Problem-Solving**: Particularly effective at debugging and offering solutions to technical issues\\n- **Nuanced Responses**: Good at understanding implicit requirements and providing thoughtful solutions\\n\\n### Strengths of Gemini 2.5 Pro\\n- **Code Generation**: Often excels at generating concise, targeted code snippets\\n- **Real-Time Knowledge**: May have more recent training data for newer frameworks/libraries\\n- **Visual Input Processing**: Better handling of visual inputs like diagrams and screenshots\\n- **Structured Outputs**: Sometimes more consistent with structured data formats\\n- **UI/UX Design**: May provide stronger guidance on visual design patterns\\n\\n### When to Use Claude 3.7 Sonnet\\n- Complex system architecture design\\n- Debugging across multiple technologies\\n- Understanding intricate logic flows\\n- Tasks requiring careful reasoning about consequences\\n- Projects needing detailed technical documentation\\n- Cross-technology integration challenges\\n\\n### When to Use Gemini 2.5 Pro\\n- UI/UX focused development\\n- Tasks that benefit from visual input processing\\n- Generating boilerplate code\\n- Working with very recent frameworks or technologies\\n- Creating concise, targeted implementations\\n\\n### General Best Practices for AI Collaboration\\n\\n1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear context and specific requirements\\n   - Bad: \\\&quot;Help me with Flutter\\\&quot;\\n   - Good: \\\&quot;Help me implement a Flutter bottom navigation bar that can embed both Flutter and native views\\\&quot;\\n\\n2. **Iterate**: Start broad, then refine with follow-up questions\\n   - Initial: \\\&quot;How should I structure this hybrid app?\\\&quot;\\n   - Follow-up: \\\&quot;For the specific case of embedding Flutter in tab 3, what\u0027s the best approach?\\\&quot;\\n\\n3. **Provide Context**: Share relevant code, constraints, and dependencies\\n   - \\\&quot;Here\u0027s my current MainActivity.kt and how I\u0027m embedding Flutter...\\\&quot;\\n   - \\\&quot;We\u0027re using Flutter 3.10 with Android API level 33\\\&quot;\\n\\n4. **Break Down Complex Tasks**: Divide large problems into manageable chunks\\n   - Instead of \\\&quot;Build the whole app,\\\&quot; start with \\\&quot;Set up the project structure for a hybrid app\\\&quot;\\n\\n5. **Use Multiple Models**: Leverage different AIs for their respective strengths\\n   - Use Claude for architecture planning and integration strategies\\n   - Use Gemini for specific UI implementations or visual design\\n\\n6. **Validate Generated Content**: Always review and test AI suggestions\\n   - AIs may provide plausible-sounding but incorrect solutions\\n   - Test all code in your specific environment\\n\\n7. **Learn from the AI**: Ask for explanations, not just solutions\\n   - \\\&quot;Why did you structure the navigation this way?\\\&quot;\\n   - \\\&quot;What are the trade-offs of this approach?\\\&quot;\\n\\n8. **Prompt Engineering**: Learn to construct effective prompts\\n   - Include constraints, preferences, and format requirements\\n   - Specify the tone and level of detail needed\\n\\nRemember that while AI assistants like Claude and Gemini are powerful tools, they work best as collaborative partners rather than autonomous developers. The most effective approach is to leverage their strengths while applying your own judgment, domain knowledge, and testing rigor.\&quot;}&quot;}}]},{&quot;role&quot;:&quot;tool&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;edit_file&quot;,&quot;tool_call_id&quot;:&quot;toolu_bdrk_01Dyyvezc4PTK3843XEpVyex&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The apply model made the following changes to the file:\n\n```\n@@ -1,1 +1,79 @@\n+# General Strategy for Effective AI/LLM Utilization\n \n+## Choosing Between Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Gemini 2.5 Pro\n+\n+As observed from Claude 3.7 Sonnet\u0027s perspective, here are strategies for effectively utilizing AI\n+systems for development tasks:\n+\n+### Strengths of Claude 3.7 Sonnet\n+\n+- **Code Understanding**: Excels at comprehending complex codebases and multi-file relationships\n+- **Contextual Reasoning**: Strong ability to maintain context across long conversations\n+- **Technical Documentation**: Produces detailed, well-structured technical documentation\n+- **Problem-Solving**: Particularly effective at debugging and offering solutions to technical\n+  issues\n+- **Nuanced Responses**: Good at understanding implicit requirements and providing thoughtful\n+  solutions\n+\n+### Strengths of Gemini 2.5 Pro\n+\n+- **Code Generation**: Often excels at generating concise, targeted code snippets\n+- **Real-Time Knowledge**: May have more recent training data for newer frameworks/libraries\n+- **Visual Input Processing**: Better handling of visual inputs like diagrams and screenshots\n+- **Structured Outputs**: Sometimes more consistent with structured data formats\n+- **UI/UX Design**: May provide stronger guidance on visual design patterns\n+\n+### When to Use Claude 3.7 Sonnet\n+\n+- Complex system architecture design\n+- Debugging across multiple technologies\n+- Understanding intricate logic flows\n+- Tasks requiring careful reasoning about consequences\n+- Projects needing detailed technical documentation\n+- Cross-technology integration challenges\n+\n+### When to Use Gemini 2.5 Pro\n+\n+- UI/UX focused development\n+- Tasks that benefit from visual input processing\n+- Generating boilerplate code\n+- Working with very recent frameworks or technologies\n+- Creating concise, targeted implementations\n+\n+### General Best Practices for AI Collaboration\n+\n+1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear context and specific requirements\n+    - Bad: \&quot;Help me with Flutter\&quot;\n+    - Good: \&quot;Help me implement a Flutter bottom navigation bar that can embed both Flutter and\n+      native views\&quot;\n+\n+2. **Iterate**: Start broad, then refine with follow-up questions\n+    - Initial: \&quot;How should I structure this hybrid app?\&quot;\n+    - Follow-up: \&quot;For the specific case of embedding Flutter in tab 3, what\u0027s the best approach?\&quot;\n+\n+3. **Provide Context**: Share relevant code, constraints, and dependencies\n+    - \&quot;Here\u0027s my current MainActivity.kt and how I\u0027m embedding Flutter...\&quot;\n+    - \&quot;We\u0027re using Flutter 3.10 with Android API level 33\&quot;\n+\n+4. **Break Down Complex Tasks**: Divide large problems into manageable chunks\n+    - Instead of \&quot;Build the whole app,\&quot; start with \&quot;Set up the project structure for a hybrid app\&quot;\n+\n+5. **Use Multiple Models**: Leverage different AIs for their respective strengths\n+    - Use Claude for architecture planning and integration strategies\n+    - Use Gemini for specific UI implementations or visual design\n+\n+6. **Validate Generated Content**: Always review and test AI suggestions\n+    - AIs may provide plausible-sounding but incorrect solutions\n+    - Test all code in your specific environment\n+\n+7. **Learn from the AI**: Ask for explanations, not just solutions\n+    - \&quot;Why did you structure the navigation this way?\&quot;\n+    - \&quot;What are the trade-offs of this approach?\&quot;\n+\n+8. **Prompt Engineering**: Learn to construct effective prompts\n+    - Include constraints, preferences, and format requirements\n+    - Specify the tone and level of detail needed\n+\n+Remember that while AI assistants like Claude and Gemini are powerful tools, they work best as\n+collaborative partners rather than autonomous developers.

Build the Flutter web app with the correct base href:\n+   ```\n+\n+flutter build web --base-href /your-repo-name/\n+\n+   ```\n+\n+2. Navigate to the build output directory:\n+   ```\n+\n+cd build/web\n+\n+   ```\n+\n+3. Create a new git repository in the build directory:\n+   ```\n+\n+git init\n+git add .\n+git commit -m \&quot;Deploy to GitHub Pages\&quot;\n+\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Add your GitHub repository as a remote:\n+   ```\n+\n+git remote add origin https://github.com/username/your-repo-name.git\n+\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Push to the gh-pages branch:\n+   ```\n+\n+git push -f origin master:gh-pages\n+\n+   ```\n+\n+## Automated Deployment with GitHub Actions\n+\n+1. Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with the following content:\n+   ```yaml\n+   name: Deploy to GitHub Pages\n+\n+   on:\n+     push:\n+       branches: [ main ]\n+\n+   jobs:\n+     build:\n+       runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n+       steps:\n+         - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n+         - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v1\n+           with:\n+             flutter-version: \u00273.10.x\u0027\n+             channel: \u0027stable\u0027\n+         - run: flutter pub get\n+         - run: flutter build web --base-href /your-repo-name/\n+         - name: Deploy\n+           uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n+           with:\n+             github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n+             publish_dir: ./build/web\n+   ```\n+\n+2.

Memory management between Swift and Flutter requires careful attention\\n\\nDue to the limited Swift/iOS experience, expect significant time investment in understanding iOS architecture concepts and Flutter integration patterns. The Firebase App Distribution stretch goal adds complexity due to iOS code signing and provisioning requirements.\\n\\nKey differences from the Android version:\\n1. UIKit navigation stack vs Android\u0027s activity/fragment stack\\n2. Universal Links vs Android deep links\\n3. Different embedding mechanism for Flutter\\n4. iOS simulator-specific considerations\\n\\nThe focus on simulator testing will simplify development by avoiding device-specific issues and code signing requirements until the optional Firebase distribution step.\&quot;}&quot;}}]},{&quot;role&quot;:&quot;tool&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;edit_file&quot;,&quot;tool_call_id&quot;:&quot;toolu_bdrk_01A5UgcWn2qesB14yiMG9FEH&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The apply model made the following changes to the file:\n\n```\n@@ -1,1 +1,185 @@\n+# Epic: iOS-Flutter Hybrid Navigation App\n \n+## Summary (TLDR)\n+\n+**Create a hybrid iOS application demonstrating seamless navigation patterns between Swift and\n+Flutter views.**\n+\n+* **Core Tech**:\n+    * Flutter module embedded in Swift iOS app\n+    * **UIKit-based** navigation with FlutterViewController integration\n+* **Key Features**:\n+    * Bottom tab bar with 5 tabs (My, Billing, Dashboard, Items, ThTif)\n+    * Both **in-tab navigation** (tab bar visible) and **modal presentations** (tab bar hidden)\n+    * **Cross-technology transitions** in both directions (Flutter↔Swift)\n+    * **Deep linking** to specific screens using Universal Links\n+* **Primary Goal**: Demonstrate consistent navigation experience across technology boundaries\n+* **Optimization**: Focused on iOS Simulator experience for easier testing\n+* **Time Estimates**:\n+    * For developer with limited iOS/Swift experience: **80-100 hours**\n+    * For experienced iOS/Swift developer: **50-70 hours**\n+\n+## Description\n+\n+Implement a comprehensive hybrid application that combines native Swift and Flutter views with\n+sophisticated navigation patterns on iOS.

FlutterViewController lifecycle management is more complex than Android\u0027s FlutterActivity\n+3. Universal Links configuration requires proper entitlements and associated domains\n+4. Memory management between Swift and Flutter requires careful attention\n+\n+Due to the limited Swift/iOS experience, expect significant time investment in understanding iOS\n+architecture concepts and Flutter integration patterns. The Firebase App Distribution stretch goal\n+adds complexity due to iOS code signing and provisioning requirements.\n+\n+Key differences from the Android version:\n+\n+1. UIKit navigation stack vs Android\u0027s activity/fragment stack\n+2. Universal Links vs Android deep links\n+3. Different embedding mechanism for Flutter\n+4. iOS simulator-specific considerations\n+\n+The focus on simulator testing will simplify development by avoiding device-specific issues and code\n+signing requirements until the optional Firebase distribution step.\n```\n\nThe edit was successful with no linter errors.&quot;},{&quot;role&quot;:&quot;assistant&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;\n\nNow let\u0027s create a story for the iOS infrastructure setup:&quot;}],&quot;tool_calls&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;toolu_bdrk_015JjjDwbUPsL2wbxqvVG9wB&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;function&quot;,&quot;function&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;edit_file&quot;,&quot;arguments&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;target_file\&quot;: \&quot;github_tickets/story_ios_01_infrastructure.md\&quot;, \&quot;instructions\&quot;: \&quot;Creating the first story for iOS infrastructure setup\&quot;, \&quot;code_edit\&quot;: \&quot;# Story: Setup iOS-Flutter Hybrid App Infrastructure\\n\\n## Summary (TLDR)\\n\\n**Set up foundational infrastructure for combining Flutter and Swift in an iOS app.**\\n\\n* **Key Setup**:\\n  * Swift iOS project with UIKit tab bar controller\\n  * Flutter module properly embedded in iOS\\n  * FlutterEngine configuration and management\\n  * Method channels for basic Swift-Flutter communication\\n* **Goal**: Create working project structure optimized for iOS Simulator\\n* **Time Estimates**:\\n  * For developer with limited iOS/Swift experience: **15-20 hours**\\n  * For experienced iOS/Swift developer: **8-12 hours**\\n\\n## Description\\nSet up the foundational infrastructure for a hybrid Swift-Flutter application with a tab bar navigation.

Add rules to the `rules` array in `firebender.json` to specify guidelines.\n\nRules apply to **all** features of Firebender such as autocomplete, chat, and inline AI changes\nFirebender supports both project-specific rules and personal rules that apply across all projects.\nSee [Configuration Files](/context/configurations) for details on setting up personal rules.\n\nTo setup rules, you need to create a json file at the project root `firebender.json`.\n\n#### [​\n](#general-rules-example%3A-food-delivery-app)General Rules Example: Food delivery app\n\nIn `$projectRoot/firebender.json`:\n\nfirebender.json\n`{\n  \&quot;rules\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;Project is a food delivery app (Doordash)\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Never use runBlocking\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Don\u0026#x27;t hardcode dpi\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Use `@SerializedName` for data/retrofit classes because code gets obfuscated\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Follow Material Design 3 guidelines and components\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Use Kotlin coroutines and Flow for asynchronous operations\&quot;,\n  ]\n}\n`\n\n#### [​](#situational-rules-example%3A-test-files)Situational Rules Example: Test files\n\nHere’s an example situational rule:\n\nfirebender.json\n`{\n  \&quot;rules\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;Project is a food delivery app (Doordash)\&quot;,\n    {\n      \&quot;filePathMatches\&quot;: [\&quot;*Kotest.kt\&quot;],\n      \&quot;rules\&quot;: [\n        \&quot;Use Kotest framework/BDD for tests\&quot;\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n`\nIf you modify the file `ProfileViewModelKotest.kt`, AI will follow the rule `Use Kotest framework/BDD for tests`. If you modify `MainActivity.kt`, AI will not be provided the irrelevant rule.\n\n`filePathMatches` follows the same regex notation as typical line in `.gitignore`.\n\n#### [​](#full-file-rules)Full file rules\n\nFor complex or extensive rules, you can use external markdown files instead of embedding all rules in `firebender.json`. This solves several problems:\n\n- JSON has limitations for long strings\n\n- Projects often already have documentation (like `README.md` or `ARCHITECTURE.md`) that can be reused\n\n- Keeps rules organized and easier to maintain\n\nfirebender.json\n`{\n  \&quot;rules\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;Use Kotlin for all new code\&quot;,\n    {\n      \&quot;filePathMatches\&quot;: \&quot;**/*.kt\&quot;,\n      \&quot;rulesPaths\&quot;: \&quot;docs/architecture.md\&quot;\n    }\n  ]\n}\n`\nWith a corresponding `docs/architecture.md` file:\n\ndocs/architecture.md\n`# Android Architecture Guidelines\n\n## UI Layer\n- Use Jetpack Compose for new UI components\n- Follow Material Design 3 guidelines\n- Implement unidirectional data flow with ViewModels\n\n## Data Layer\n- Use Room for local database storage\n- Implement Repository pattern for data access\n- Use Retrofit for network operations\n`\nFirebender will include both inline rules and rules from the referenced external files when processing matching files.\n\n#### [​\n](#reading-errors)Reading Errors\n\nRules will use the latest file saved immediately. If there are parsing errors it will tell you which fields were incorrect:\n\nIn this case, `rules[0].filePathMatches` is supposed to be a `string` and not an `array`.\n\nFor a complete reference of the rules syntax including advanced patterns and configuration options, see the [Rules Syntax Documentation](https://docs.firebender.com/rules/syntax).\n\nWas this page helpful?\nYesNo[Configuration Files](/context/configurations)[Ignore Files](/context/ignore)On this page\n- [General Rules Example: Food delivery app](#general-rules-example%3A-food-delivery-app)\n- [Situational Rules Example: Test files](#situational-rules-example%3A-test-files)\n- [Full file rules](#full-file-rules)\n- [Reading Errors](#reading-errors)\n\n# https://docs.firehydrant.com/docs/markdown-support\n# Markdown Support | FireHydrant\n\nYou can use Markdown formatting to write structured content with FireHydrant.

It\u0027s designed to be easy to use and maintain, even for teams without deep programming knowledge.\\n\\n**Q: Why are we using Maestro for this project?**\\nA: Maestro is well-suited for our hybrid Flutter-Kotlin/Swift app because it\u0027s cross-platform, technology-agnostic (tests Flutter and native screens seamlessly), and easy to integrate with CI/CD pipelines.\\n\\n**Q: Do I need to know how to code to write Maestro tests?**\\nA: No, Maestro tests are written in YAML, which is a human-readable data serialization language. Basic understanding of UI elements and user flows is more important than programming skills.\\n\\n**Q: Can Maestro test both Android and iOS?**\\nA: Yes, Maestro supports both Android and iOS platforms with the same test flows, though you might need platform-specific flows for certain features.\\n\\n## Writing Tests\\n\\n**Q: How do I identify UI elements for Maestro to interact with?**\\nA: Maestro can identify elements by text, accessibility ID, or by their position. The Maestro Studio tool can also help in identifying elements.\\n\\n**Q: Can Maestro handle complex gestures?**\\nA: Yes, Maestro supports common gestures like tap, long press, swipe, and pinch.\\n\\n**Q: How does Maestro handle dynamic content or delays?**\\nA: Maestro has built-in commands like `waitFor`, `assertVisible`, and `assertNotVisible` with timeout options to handle dynamic content and network delays.\\n\\n**Q: Can I run platform-specific test steps?**\\nA: Yes, Maestro allows you to define platform-specific conditions for test steps using `runFlow` with conditions or by organizing flows into platform-specific subdirectories.\\n\\n## Running Tests\\n\\n**Q: How do I run a single Maestro test flow?**\\nA: Use the command `maestro test flows/your_flow_name.yaml`.\\n\\n**Q: How do I run all tests in a directory?**\\nA: Use `maestro test flows/` to run all YAML files in the `flows` directory and its subdirectories.\\n\\n**Q: Can I get screenshots or videos of my test runs?**\\nA: Yes, Maestro automatically takes screenshots at each step. You can get videos by using the `--video` flag: `maestro test --video flows/your_flow_name.yaml`.\\n\\n**Q: What is Maestro Studio?**\\nA: Maestro Studio is a tool that helps you inspect your app\u0027s UI hierarchy and identify elements, making it easier to write test flows. You can launch it with `maestro studio`.\\n\\n## Integration\\n\\n**Q: Can Maestro be integrated into our CI/CD pipeline?**\\nA: Yes, Maestro is designed for CI/CD integration. It can be run from the command line and generates reports that can be consumed by CI systems. We plan to integrate it with GitHub Actions.\\n\\n**Q: What is Maestro Cloud?**\\nA: Maestro Cloud is a service offered by the Maestro team for running your tests on real devices in the cloud. It provides features like parallel execution and detailed reporting.\\n\\n## Troubleshooting\\n\\n**Q: My test is failing, but I don\u0027t know why. What should I do?**\\nA: Check the Maestro output in the console for detailed error messages. Review the screenshots generated for each step to see the app\u0027s state when the failure occurred. You can also use Maestro Studio to inspect the UI at the point of failure. Refer to our `troubleshooting.md` for more tips.\\n\\n**Q: How do I find the `appId` for my application?**\\nA: For Android, it\u0027s the `applicationId` in your `app/build.gradle` file. For iOS, it\u0027s the `Bundle Identifier` found in your Xcode project settings (General tab).\&quot;}&quot;}}]},{&quot;role&quot;:&quot;tool&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;edit_file&quot;,&quot;tool_call_id&quot;:&quot;portkey-4b5011c3-5762-461d-bf09-bf4c51295e3e&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The apply model made the following changes to the file:\n\n```\n@@ -1,1 +1,75 @@\n+# Maestro FAQ\n \n+## General Questions\n+\n+**Q: What is Maestro?**\n+A: Maestro is a mobile UI testing framework that uses a simple YAML-based syntax to define test\n+flows.

It uses a simple YAML-based syntax to define test flows, making it easy to\nwrite and understand tests without deep programming knowledge.\n\n## Why Maestro for Our Hybrid App?\n\nMaestro offers several advantages for testing our hybrid Flutter-Kotlin navigation app:\n\n- **Cross-Platform**: Works with both Android and iOS\n- **Technology Agnostic**: Tests Flutter and native screens seamlessly\n- **Easy Syntax**: Simple YAML format is readable and maintainable\n- **Visual Verification**: Captures screenshots at each step\n- **CI Integration**: Easy to integrate with GitHub Actions\n- **Rich Reports**: Generates detailed test reports and videos\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n```\nmaestro/\n├── README.md           # This overview file\n├── quickstart.md       # Getting started guide\n├── faq.md              # Frequently asked questions\n├── troubleshooting.md  # Common issues and solutions\n├── flows/              # Test flow definition files\n│   ├── hello_world.yaml   # Simple test to verify setup\n│   ├── navigation/        # Navigation test flows\n│   ├── deep_linking/      # Deep linking test flows\n│   └── cross_platform/    # Tests that work on both iOS and Android\n└── scripts/            # Helper scripts for running tests\n```\n\n## Key Resources\n\n- [Maestro Documentation](https://maestro.mobile.dev/)\n- [Installation Guide](https://maestro.mobile.dev/getting-started/installing-maestro)\n- [YAML Flow Syntax](https://maestro.mobile.dev/api-reference/commands)\n- [CI Integration Guide](https://maestro.mobile.dev/getting-started/maestro-cloud)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nSee our [Quickstart Guide](./quickstart.md) to install Maestro and run your first test.\n\nFor common issues, check the [Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Running Tests Locally\n\n```bash\n# Run a specific test flow\nmaestro test flows/hello_world.yaml\n\n# Run all test flows\nmaestro test flows/\n\n# Run with video recording\nmaestro test --video flows/hello_world.yaml\n```\n```&quot;},{&quot;role&quot;:&quot;assistant&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&quot;}],&quot;tool_calls&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;toolu_bdrk_0187wc9yvH5EHAPzkAWbyQc8&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;function&quot;,&quot;function&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;read_file&quot;,&quot;arguments&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;relative_workspace_path\&quot;: \&quot;maestro/quickstart.md\&quot;, \&quot;explanation\&quot;: \&quot;Checking if quickstart.md already exists in the maestro directory\&quot;}&quot;}}]},{&quot;role&quot;:&quot;tool&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;read_file&quot;,&quot;tool_call_id&quot;:&quot;toolu_bdrk_0187wc9yvH5EHAPzkAWbyQc8&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Contents of maestro/quickstart.md:\n```\n# Maestro Quickstart Guide\n\nThis guide will help you get started with Maestro UI testing for our hybrid Flutter-Kotlin\nnavigation app.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- macOS, Windows, or Linux\n- [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio) for Android testing\n- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for iOS testing (macOS only)\n- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)\n\n### 1. Install Maestro CLI\n\n**macOS**:\n\n```bash\ncurl -Ls \&quot;https://get.maestro.mobile.dev\&quot; | bash\n```\n\n**Windows**:\n\n```bash\npowershell -Command \&quot;iwr -useb https://get.maestro.mobile.dev/win | iex\&quot;\n```\n\n**Linux**:\n\n```bash\ncurl -Ls \&quot;https://get.maestro.mobile.dev\&quot; | bash\n```\n\n### 2. Verify Installation\n\n```bash\nmaestro --version\n```\n\nYou should see the Maestro version number, confirming it\u0027s installed correctly.\n\n## Running Your First Test\n\n### 1. Create flows directory\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p maestro/flows\n```\n\n### 2. Create a hello_world.yaml test\n\nCreate a file at `maestro/flows/hello_world.yaml` with this content:\n\n```yaml\nappId: com.example.myflutternavbarapplication # Replace with your app\u0027s ID\n---\n# Launch the app\n- launchApp\n\n# Wait for app to load\n- waitForAnimationToEnd\n\n# Verify the first tab is selected\n- assertVisible:\n    text: \&quot;My\&quot; # Text on the first tab\n\n# This step will intentionally fail for demonstration\n- assertVisible:\n    text: \&quot;This text doesn\u0027t exist in the app\&quot;\n    timeout: 5000\n```\n\n### 3. Run the test on a connected device or emulator\n\nEnsure you have an Android emulator or iOS simulator running, or a physical device connected.\n\n```bash\nmaestro test flows/hello_world.yaml\n```\n\n### 4. Observe the failure\n\nThe test will fail at the last step because \&quot;This text doesn\u0027t exist in the app\&quot; isn\u0027t present. This\nconfirms Maestro is working and can detect issues.\n\n## Creating a Real Test\n\nLet\u0027s modify our test to actually validate tab navigation:\n\n```yaml\nappId: com.example.myflutternavbarapplication # Replace with your app\u0027s ID\n---\n# Launch the app\n- launchApp\n\n# Wait for app to load\n- waitForAnimationToEnd\n  \n# Take a screenshot of the starting state\n- takeScreenshot: start-state\n\n# Verify the My tab is visible\n- assertVisible:\n    text: \&quot;My\&quot;\n\n# Tap on the Billing tab\n- tapOn:\n    text: \&quot;Billing\&quot;\n\n# Verify we navigated to the Billing tab\n- assertVisible:\n    text: \&quot;Billing\&quot; \n    \n# Take a screenshot of Billing tab\n- takeScreenshot: billing-tab\n\n# Tap on the Dashboard tab\n- tapOn:\n    text: \&quot;Dashboard\&quot;\n    \n# Verify we navigated to the Dashboard tab\n- assertVisible:\n    text: \&quot;Dashboard\&quot;\n\n# Take a screenshot of Dashboard tab\n- takeScreenshot: dashboard-tab\n```\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

It\u0027s designed to be easy to use and maintain, even for teams without deep programming\nknowledge.\n\n**Q: Why are we using Maestro for this project?**\nA: Maestro is well-suited for our hybrid Flutter-Kotlin/Swift app because it\u0027s cross-platform,\ntechnology-agnostic (tests Flutter and native screens seamlessly), and easy to integrate with CI/CD\npipelines.\n\n**Q: Do I need to know how to code to write Maestro tests?**\nA: No, Maestro tests are written in YAML, which is a human-readable data serialization language.\nBasic understanding of UI elements and user flows is more important than programming skills.\n\n**Q: Can Maestro test both Android and iOS?**\nA: Yes, Maestro supports both Android and iOS platforms with the same test flows, though you might\nneed platform-specific flows for certain features.\n\n## Writing Tests\n\n**Q: How do I identify UI elements for Maestro to interact with?**\nA: Maestro can identify elements by text, accessibility ID, or by their position. The Maestro Studio\ntool can also help in identifying elements.\n\n**Q: Can Maestro handle complex gestures?**\nA: Yes, Maestro supports common gestures like tap, long press, swipe, and pinch.\n\n**Q: How does Maestro handle dynamic content or delays?**\nA: Maestro has built-in commands like `waitFor`, `assertVisible`, and `assertNotVisible` with\ntimeout options to handle dynamic content and network delays.\n\n**Q: Can I run platform-specific test steps?**\nA: Yes, Maestro allows you to define platform-specific conditions for test steps using `runFlow`\nwith conditions or by organizing flows into platform-specific subdirectories.\n\n## Running Tests\n\n**Q: How do I run a single Maestro test flow?**\nA: Use the command `maestro test flows/your_flow_name.yaml`.\n\n**Q: How do I run all tests in a directory?**\nA: Use `maestro test flows/` to run all YAML files in the `flows` directory and its subdirectories.\n\n**Q: Can I get screenshots or videos of my test runs?**\nA: Yes, Maestro automatically takes screenshots at each step. You can get videos by using the\n`--video` flag: `maestro test --video flows/your_flow_name.yaml`.\n\n**Q: What is Maestro Studio?**\nA: Maestro Studio is a tool that helps you inspect your app\u0027s UI hierarchy and identify elements,\nmaking it easier to write test flows. You can launch it with `maestro studio`.\n\n## Integration\n\n**Q: Can Maestro be integrated into our CI/CD pipeline?**\nA: Yes, Maestro is designed for CI/CD integration. It can be run from the command line and generates\nreports that can be consumed by CI systems. We plan to integrate it with GitHub Actions.\n\n**Q: What is Maestro Cloud?**\nA: Maestro Cloud is a service offered by the Maestro team for running your tests on real devices in\nthe cloud. It provides features like parallel execution and detailed reporting.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Q: My test is failing, but I don\u0027t know why. What should I do?**\nA: Check the Maestro output in the console for detailed error messages. Review the screenshots\ngenerated for each step to see the app\u0027s state when the failure occurred. You can also use Maestro\nStudio to inspect the UI at the point of failure. Refer to our `troubleshooting.md` for more tips.\n\n**Q: How do I find the `appId` for my application?**\nA: For Android, it\u0027s the `applicationId` in your `app/build.gradle` file. For iOS, it\u0027s the\n`Bundle Identifier` found in your Xcode project settings (General tab).\n```&quot;},{&quot;role&quot;:&quot;assistant&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;\n\nNow I\u0027ll create a troubleshooting.md file, a sample hello_world.yaml failing test, and a GitHub epic for Maestro testing.\n\nFirst, let\u0027s create the troubleshooting.md file:&quot;}],&quot;tool_calls&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;toolu_bdrk_01Vw8otwMTUr5fMUzjBn5WmC&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;function&quot;,&quot;function&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;edit_file&quot;,&quot;arguments&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;target_file\&quot;: \&quot;maestro/troubleshooting.md\&quot;, \&quot;instructions\&quot;: \&quot;I\u0027m creating a troubleshooting guide for Maestro testing.\&quot;, \&quot;code_edit\&quot;: \&quot;# Maestro Troubleshooting Guide\\n\\n## Common Issues and Solutions\\n\\n### Installation Issues\\n\\n**Problem**: Maestro installation fails with permission errors.\\n**Solution**: Try running the installation command with sudo:\\n```bash\\nsudo curl -Ls \\\&quot;https://get.maestro.mobile.dev\\\&quot; | bash\\n```\\n\\n**Problem**: Maestro installed but command not found.\\n**Solution**: Ensure Maestro is in your PATH.

using Maestro for our hybrid Flutter-Kotlin\n+  navigation app\n+* **Key Components**: Test infrastructure setup, automated test flows, CI/CD integration, video\n+  capture, and analytics\n+* **Focus Areas**: Navigation testing, deep linking validation, cross-platform compatibility\n+* **Deliverables**: Working test suite, GitHub Actions integration, demo videos, and AI test\n+  analysis\n+\n+## Background\n+\n+Our hybrid Flutter-Kotlin navigation app requires thorough UI testing to ensure consistent behavior\n+across platforms and between native and Flutter components. Maestro provides an excellent solution\n+with its YAML-based test flows that can interact with both Flutter and native elements seamlessly.\n+\n+## Goals\n+\n+- Create a maintainable Maestro test suite for the app\n+- Automate UI testing as part of our CI/CD pipeline\n+- Generate visual evidence of app functionality (screenshots/videos)\n+- Use AI-powered analysis to identify potential UI/UX issues\n+- Deploy tests to a cloud-based testing service for broader device coverage\n+\n+## Non-Goals\n+\n+- Replacing unit and integration tests\n+- Testing backend API functionality directly\n+-

Then create github stories under the epic for appropriate\\nstories for a reasonable plan where the first is the \\\&quot;skeleton\\\&quot;. Make them all copy/pasteable md\\nfiles for github ticket description also with AI section that contains the LOE with Firebender with\\nClaude Sonnet 3.7 and/or Gemini 2.5 Pro, as well as on a scale of 1 to 10 the likelihood of success,\\nlikelihood of frustration, likelihood of manual steps and an estimate of number of hours it will\\ntake\\n\\n**AI:** Created the requested folder structure, AI guidance document, and individual story tickets\\nwith detailed metrics.\\n\\n#### 14:50:33 - Developer Profile Update\\n\\n**User:** Change all the project metrics and time estimates to consider that a senior Flutter\\nDeveloper is working on it with Kotlin background 5 years past\\n\\n**AI:** Updated all metrics and time estimates across all tickets to reflect the experience level of\\nthe developer.\\n\\n#### 15:00:27 - Second Epic Request\\n\\n**User:** Make the description for the first epic be epic1_navigation and make a second epic be web\\nand do the same plan with the same pattern and metrics but taking into account 1) The flutter dev\\nwill have minimal web knowledge 2) The flutter code should need almost no modifications for\\nnavigation demo and 3) Initial demo is with index.html and flutter_run_chrome. Make a ticket for the\\ndemo with good steps to demo, and make a ticket for deploy to github pages with good steps to do\\nthat.\\n\\n**AI:** Created a second epic for web deployment with 5 detailed stories, considering the\\ndeveloper\u0027s minimal web knowledge.\\n\\n#### 15:10:15 - Final Documentation Request\\n\\n**User:** Add an ai_interactions_log file with the timestamp for all of these prompts and the\\nrecord/history of prompts and create a firebender.json file to maintain the prompt history. Also\\nupdate the demo environment to take into account that flutter_run_chrome should be corrected to\\nwhatever the simplest way to run locally on mac is such as open -a web/index.html or similar, with\\nsome notes on running/debugging from IDE if feasible\\n\\n**AI:** Creating the AI interactions log, firebender.json file, and updating the demo environment\\nstory with correct Mac-specific instructions.\\n\\n#### 15:25:30 - Platform Communication Epic Request\\n\\n**User:** Update interaction log and create an epic with stories for demonstrating 1) Demonstrating\\npigeon usage with 2 examples and 2) Demonstrating converting one of those two JNIGen. Use some\\nreasonable simple easy to understand possibilities such as updating the app bar from flutter even if\\nit\u0027s and Android route or vice versa, possibly using the default battery level method channel,\\npossibly hello world or adding two numbers and gettting a sum or a fake api call- optimize for\\nunderstandable first, real-world simulation second, speed of implementation third and ease of\\nimplementation fourth.\\n\\n**AI:** Updated the interaction log and created a new epic focusing on platform communication using\\nPigeon and JNIGen with stories for simple, understandable examples prioritized by clarity and\\nreal-world applicability.\\n\\n#### 15:40:15 - TLDR Request\\n\\n**User:** awesome! Give each story a summary/TLDR section at the top for people reviewing to just\\nskim a few lines and understand the purpose and genral idea. (also update ai interaations for this\\nprompt)\\n\\n**AI:** Added a concise TLDR section to each story ticket to allow reviewers to quickly understand\\nthe purpose and general idea without reading the entire ticket, and updated the AI interactions log.\\n\\n#### 15:50:20 - Summary Section Enhancement\\n\\n**User:** call the TLDR sections Summary (TLDR) and do it for every single github, optimize each\\nTLDR for readability, quick skimming, bullet points, bold or highlight, in particular the epics.

ticket for a kotlin host app that has tabs My,Billing, Dashboard, Items\\nand ThTif and the bottom navbar is flutter and the home view is kotlin (the host app) and the\\nBilling, Items and ThTif view is flutter. ThTif view should be a flutter view that says To Host Then\\nInner Flutter for the title with a button that says \\\&quot;To Host\\\&quot; that goes to a Kotlin/android view and\\na \\\&quot;To Inner Flutter View\\\&quot; button that goes back to a flutter view\\n\\n**AI:** Created a GitHub ticket with hybrid app requirements, tab structure, and navigation\\npatterns.\\n\\n#### 14:18:45 - README Request\\n\\n**User:** Please give me readme I can copy/paste into github\\n\\n**AI:** Created a comprehensive README.md with project overview, features, technical overview, and\\nsetup instructions.\\n\\n#### 14:22:10 - GitHub Issue Format Request\\n\\n**User:** Can I please have some markdown I can copy/paste for the github issue\\n\\n**AI:** Created concise markdown formatted specifically for a GitHub issue with requirements,\\ntechnical considerations, and acceptance criteria.\\n\\n#### 14:25:30 - Navigation Pattern Enhancement\\n\\n**User:** Modify to make some tabs show navigating backstack within the navigationbar and some show\\nnavigating \\\&quot;out\\\&quot; where the navigation bar does not show. Show each of these within Flutter and Host\\nso that it is clearly demonstrated the backstack will \\\&quot;work\\\&quot; as expected regardless of tab and\\ntechnology used\\n\\n**AI:** Updated the ticket to include detailed navigation patterns, showing both in-tab and\\nfull-screen navigation scenarios across both technology stacks.\\n\\n#### 14:30:15 - Epic Story Format Request\\n\\n**User:** Please make me a github_epic_description.md file with this info plus an AI section that\\ncontains the LOE with Firebender with Claude Sonnet 3.7 and/or Gemini 2.5 Pro, as well as on a scale\\nof 1 to 10 the likelihood of success, likelihood of frustration, likelihood of manual steps and an\\nestimate of number of hours it will take\\n\\n**AI:** Created a comprehensive epic description with detailed subtasks, metrics for AI assistance,\\nand time estimates.\\n\\n#### 14:35:40 - Detailed Navigation Requirements\\n\\n**User:** This will be a story/epic with subtasks so please make items be a listview in this plan\\nwhere items will be a flutter listview and item7 will go to a flutter item detail page that can be\\ndeep linked to and that billing will be a Kotlin Item Detail Page for a bill that goes to a Kotlin\\nview than can be deeplinked to and Dashboard will have a \\\&quot;Request Service\\\&quot; button that goes to a\\nFlutter with no navigation bar and \\\&quot;My\\\&quot; Will be a Kotlin view that has a \\\&quot;Review Contact Info\\\&quot; CtA\\nButton that goes to a Flutter view that is still in the bottom navigation bar and an add person view\\nthat goes to a flutter page that shows a spinner and feels like a new section of the app that does\\nnot have the navigation bar\\n\\n**AI:** Enhanced the epic with detailed navigation requirements for each tab, including specific UI\\nelements and navigation patterns.\\n\\n#### 14:42:12 - Project Structure Request\\n\\n**User:** Please make an ai_guidance folder and a github tickets folder and put the epic ticket in\\nit. Then please create a file in the ai folder general_strategy.md with general advice on how to be\\neffective with AI/LLMS especially as it relates to how to choose between 3.7 Sonnet and Gemini, but\\nnote that this advice is from Sonnet. Then create github stories under the epic for appropriate\\nstories for a reasonable plan where the first is the \\\&quot;skeleton\\\&quot;. Make them all copy/pasteable md\\nfiles for github ticket description also with AI section that contains the LOE with Firebender with\\nClaude Sonnet 3.7 and/or Gemini 2.5 Pro, as well as on a scale of 1 to 10 the likelihood of success,\\nlikelihood of frustration, likelihood of manual steps and an estimate of number of hours it will\\ntake\\n\\n**AI:** Created the requested folder structure, AI guidance document, and individual story tickets\\nwith detailed metrics.\\n\\n#### 14:50:33 - Developer Profile Update\\n\\n**User:** Change all the project metrics and time estimates to consider that a senior Flutter\\nDeveloper is working on it with Kotlin background 5 years past\\n\\n**AI:** Updated all metrics and time estimates across all tickets to reflect the experience level of\\nthe developer.\\n\\n#### 15:00:27 - Second Epic Request\\n\\n**User:** Make the description for the first epic be epic1_navigation and make a second epic be web\\nand do the same plan with the same pattern and metrics but taking into account 1) The flutter dev\\nwill have minimal web knowledge 2) The flutter code should need almost no modifications for\\nnavigation demo and 3) Initial demo is with index.html and flutter_run_chrome. Make a ticket for the\\ndemo with good steps to demo, and make a ticket for deploy to github pages with good steps to do\\nthat.\\n\\n**AI:** Created a second epic for web deployment with 5 detailed stories, considering the\\ndeveloper\u0027s minimal web knowledge.\\n\\n#### 15:10:15 - Final Documentation Request\\n\\n**User:** Add an ai_interactions_log file with the timestamp for all of these prompts and the\\nrecord/history of prompts and create a firebender.json file to maintain the prompt history. Also\\nupdate the demo environment to take into account that flutter_run_chrome should be corrected to\\nwhatever the simplest way to run locally on mac is such as open -a web/index.html or similar, with\\nsome notes on running/debugging from IDE if feasible\\n\\n**AI:** Creating the AI interactions log, firebender.json file, and updating the demo environment\\nstory with correct Mac-specific instructions.\\n\\n#### 15:25:30 - Platform Communication Epic Request\\n\\n**User:** Update interaction log and create an epic with stories for demonstrating 1) Demonstrating\\npigeon usage with 2 examples and 2) Demonstrating converting one of those two JNIGen. Use some\\nreasonable simple easy to understand possibilities such as updating the app bar from flutter even if\\nit\u0027s and Android route or vice versa, possibly using the default battery level method channel,\\npossibly hello world or adding two numbers and gettting a sum or a fake api call- optimize for\\nunderstandable first, real-world simulation second, speed of implementation third and ease of\\nimplementation fourth.\\n\\n**AI:** Updated the interaction log and created a new epic focusing on platform communication using\\nPigeon and JNIGen with stories for simple, understandable examples prioritized by clarity and\\nreal-world applicability.\\n\\n#### 15:40:15 - TLDR Request\\n\\n**User:** awesome! Give each story a summary/TLDR section at the top for people reviewing to just\\nskim a few lines and understand the purpose and genral idea. (also update ai interaations for this\\nprompt)\\n\\n**AI:** Added a concise TLDR section to each story ticket to allow reviewers to quickly understand\\nthe purpose and general idea without reading the entire ticket, and updated the AI interactions log.\\n\\n#### 15:50:20 - Summary Section Enhancement\\n\\n**User:** call the TLDR sections Summary (TLDR) and do it for every single github, optimize each\\nTLDR for readability, quick skimming, bullet points, bold or highlight, in particular the epics. Do\\nthis for every github issue in the project so far and add this interaction to the ai interactions\\nlog\\n\\n**AI:** Renamed all TLDR sections to \\\&quot;Summary (TLDR)\\\&quot; and enhanced them with bullet points, bold\\ntext, and improved formatting for better skimming. Updated every GitHub issue in the project\\nincluding epics and stories for consistent presentation.\\n\\n#### 15:29:00 - Documentation and Format Refinements\\n\\n**User:** please refer to firebender docs to see if that is really what their rules are supposed to\\nlook like, keeping in mind that the tldr section only should apply to MD files, and add this\\ninteraction to thel ogs, and alos it\u0027s not 2023, please make the session say the correct date and\\ntime, it\u0027s 3:29pm in my time (central time) on May 22nd. Then create a devx.md file with some tips\\non how to optimize this process if i have two monitors, how i can review and keep tabs on the\\nprocess with DITL (developer in the loop vibe coding), and make each github ticket have a \\\&quot;simplest\\nbare minimum test cases\\\&quot; section.\\n\\n**AI:** Researched Firebender docs for guidance on markdown formats, updated all session timestamps\\nto May 22nd, 2024 at 3:29 PM CT, created a developer experience guide with tips for dual-monitor\\nsetups and DITL workflows, and added \\\&quot;Simplest Bare Minimum Test Cases\\\&quot; sections to all GitHub\\ntickets.\\n\\n#### 15:45:00 - iOS Version Request\\n\\n**User:** now create another epic to do all of this for a new project with the host app as iOS. Keep\\nin mind the flutter developer has limited swift/ios experience, but include metrics in case a dev\\nmore experienced in ios/swt takes on the epic. Optimize for demo on the simulator but include an\\noptional/stretch goal story to deploy to firebase app distribution\\n\\n**AI:** Created a comprehensive iOS-Flutter hybrid navigation epic with adjusted metrics for both\\ndevelopers with limited iOS experience and experienced iOS developers. Included two detailed\\nstories - one for initial infrastructure setup and one for the optional Firebase App Distribution\\ndeployment as a stretch goal. The epic focuses on iOS simulator demonstration while maintaining\\nparallel navigation patterns to the Android version.\\n\\n#### 16:20:00 - Maestro Testing Setup\\n\\n**User:** please finish this propmt \\\&quot;make a maestro directory with a readme md a quickstart md and a\\nfaq md and a troubleshooting md file with a hello world failing test that i can check right now and\\na maestro github epic with maestro story or two - the maestro tests shoudl mostly be done with the\\nstories they are part of but a spike abaout ai analysis and a story about github actions deployment\\nand a story about getting videos and a story about deploying to a service that is free for open\\nsource projects such as i think it\u0027s called testingrobot and a story for making a really nice\\npitch/demo/loom for maestro\\\&quot; and put it in the ai interactions log\\n\\n**AI:** Created a complete Maestro testing setup including:\\n\\n1. Comprehensive documentation (README.md, QUICKSTART.md, FAQ.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md)\\n2. A failing hello_world.yaml test for immediate verification\\n3. A GitHub epic (epic5_maestro_testing.md) with detailed testing strategy\\n4.

This will help catch regressions early and provide visual evidence of the app\u0027s functionality through screenshots and videos. The workflow will support Android testing initially, with preparation for web testing that will be implemented in a separate story.\\n\\n## Tasks\\n\\n1. **GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration**\\n   - Create a new workflow file for Maestro tests\\n   - Configure the workflow to run on pull requests and pushes to the main branch\\n   - Set up appropriate triggers and conditions for running tests\\n   - Structure workflow to accommodate both Android and web platforms\\n   - Configure caching for dependencies to speed up builds\\n\\n2. **Android Emulator Setup**\\n   - Configure an appropriate Android emulator in the GitHub Actions environment\\n   - Ensure the emulator is set up with the right API level and configuration\\n   - Optimize emulator settings for CI environment (memory, disk space)\\n   - Set up scripts to wait for emulator readiness\\n\\n3. **Maestro Integration**\\n   - Install Maestro in the GitHub Actions environment\\n   - Configure Maestro to run against the built app on the emulator\\n   - Set up test selection logic based on platform (Android vs web)\\n   - Ensure tests use accessibility IDs for stable identification\\n   - Configure video recording for test runs\\n\\n4. **Web Testing Preparation**\\n   - Add configuration for web platform in the workflow (to be activated later)\\n   - Ensure workflow structure supports running web tests\\n   - Document requirements for web Maestro testing\\n   - Prepare for the web testing story that will follow\\n\\n5. **Artifact Management**\\n   - Configure artifact collection for test reports\\n   - Set up screenshot and video artifact storage\\n   - Ensure artifacts are retained for an appropriate period\\n   - Organize artifacts by platform (Android/web)\\n   - Create clear and descriptive artifact names\\n\\n6. **Status Checks and Reporting**\\n   - Configure status checks based on test outcomes\\n   - Set up notifications for test failures\\n   - Create summary reports of test results\\n   - Add links to artifacts in PR comments\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n- GitHub Actions workflow successfully runs Maestro tests on Android for PRs\\n- Tests execute on an appropriate Android emulator\\n- Tests use accessibility IDs when available instead of just text matchers\\n- Screenshots and videos are captured and stored as artifacts\\n- Workflow structure supports future web testing integration\\n- Pull requests receive a status check based on test results\\n- Test failures provide clear information about the failure point\\n- Workflow completes in a reasonable time (\u003c 15 minutes)\\n- Artifacts are accessible and organized logically by platform\\n\\n## Technical Details\\nThe workflow should:\\n\\n- Use a matrix strategy to define platform configurations\\n- Use appropriate caching for dependencies and build outputs\\n- Leverage GitHub Actions\u0027 built-in artifact storage\\n- Have proper retry mechanisms for flaky tests or environment setup\\n- Execute only relevant tests based on changed files (optional)\\n\\nExample workflow structure with platform support:\\n\\n```yaml\\nname: Maestro UI Tests\\n\\non:\\n  pull_request:\\n    branches: [ main ]\\n  push:\\n    branches: [ main ]\\n\\njobs:\\n  maestro-tests:\\n    strategy:\\n      matrix:\\n        platform: [android] # web will be added later\\n        include:\\n          - platform: android\\n            runs-on: macos-latest\\n            test-path: maestro/flows/android\\n    \\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.runs-on }}\\n    timeout-minutes: 30\\n    \\n    steps:\\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\\n      \\n      # Setup steps (Java, Flutter, Android SDK, etc.)\\n      \\n      # Platform-specific build and setup\\n      - name: Build app for ${{ matrix.platform }}\\n        run: |\\n          if [ \\\&quot;${{ matrix.platform }}\\\&quot;

We will refactor parts of our Kotlin UI code while maintaining or improving the test coverage.

Aim for intuitive behavior.\\n*   **Deliverable:** Working demo of Android native launching Flutter, and Flutter triggering a native action.\\n\\n**(1.5 hours) Task 5: Navigation - Deep Links \u0026 Web Preview**\\n*   **Objective:** Implement a simple Android deep link and briefly explore Web navigation.\\n*   **Activities:**\\n    *   (45 min) Android: Implement one simple deep link that navigates to a specific Flutter screen. Test it.\\n    *   (30 min) Flutter Web: Get the app running on Web (if not already). Explore how basic navigation (e.g., `Navigator.pushNamed`) works. Note differences/challenges compared to mobile.\\n    *   (15 min) Revisit backstack: Briefly test deep link and web navigation impact on backstack.\\n*   **Deliverable:** A working Android deep link. Flutter app running on Web with basic navigation demonstrated or understood.\\n\\n**(1 hour) Task 6: JNIgen - Bridging Dart to Kotlin**\\n*   **Objective:** Complete the JNIgen demo by calling the native Kotlin function from Dart.\\n*   **Activities:**\\n    *   (30 min) Run JNIgen to generate the Dart bindings for your Kotlin function.\\n    *   (20 min) Call the generated Dart function from your Flutter UI (e.g., on a button press, display the result).\\n    *   (10 min) Test and confirm it works.\\n*   **Deliverable:** A working demo of a Flutter app calling a Kotlin function via JNIgen and displaying the result.\\n\\n**(0.5 hours) Task 7: Review, Polish \u0026 Demo Prep**\\n*   **Objective:** Consolidate learnings and prepare for showcasing the demos.\\n*   **Activities:**\\n    *   (15 min) Quickly run through all three demos.\\n    *   (10 min) Jot down key talking points for each demo, highlighting what was achieved.\\n    *   (5 min) Identify any immediate next steps or major \\\&quot;aha!\\\&quot; moments.\\n*   **Deliverable:** Smoothly runnable demos, concise explanation points.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Key Considerations \u0026 \\\&quot;Life Coach\\\&quot; Pep Talk:\\n\\n*   **Timeboxing is King:** Stick to the allocated times. If you\u0027re hitting a wall, make a note and move on. The goal is breadth of demonstration in this sprint.\\n*   **Simplicity is Your Superpower:** For each demo, aim for the *simplest possible thing that works*.

The success of this PR will be primarily validated by three corresponding Maestro test flows.\n\n**Key changes and emphasis:**\n*   The Day 1 walk break is removed.\n*   Day 1 is dedicated to the Maestro MVT and then laying the foundational code for all three navigation flows of PR #2, including the initial JNIgen setup.\n*   Day 2 is about completing each of these three flows, developing their Maestro validation tests, and ensuring the specified bottom navigation bar behavior is met.\n*   The JNIgen demo is now an integral part of the \&quot;Flutter-Kotlin-Flutter\&quot; flow.\n*   A significant portion of time at the end is dedicated to polishing PR #2 and, crucially, documenting all deferred items, simplifications, and next steps in its \&quot;Future Polish \u0026 Content Blueprint\&quot; section. This will also feed into creating a couple of high-level GitHub issues for major follow-on work.\n\nThis plan is very aggressive. The definition of \&quot;done\&quot; for each flow within this timebox will be its successful execution and validation via a Maestro test. The \&quot;Future Polish\&quot; notes will be vital for capturing everything needed to take these MVDs to a production-ready or \&quot;excellent demo\&quot; state later.\n\nThe `ai_interactions.log` is also updated.\n\nLet me know when you\u0027re ready to tackle Task 1: PR #1 - Maestro MVT!&quot;}]},{&quot;role&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;\u003cuser_query\u003e\nquick correction please, 2 PRs are just for day1 for meastro 12 minute then for navigation demo.

But we want to build towards excellence. Here\u0027s how to manage\nyour Git workflow and use an LLM like Claude effectively:\n\n**A. For You (The Human Developer) - During the Sprint:**\n\n1. **Issue per Task/MVD:** Create a simple GitHub issue for each major task (e.g., \&quot;MVD: Maestro\n   Simple Demo,\&quot; \&quot;MVD: Android \u003c-\u003e Flutter Nav\&quot;).\n    * **Checklist for MVD:** Clearly list the 2-3 absolute minimum criteria for the demo to be \&quot;\n      done\&quot; for this sprint.\n2. **Small, Focused PRs for MVDs:**\n    * Branch for each issue (e.g., `feature/mvd-maestro-demo`).\n    * Submit a PR when the MVD checklist for that issue is met.\n    * **PR Title:** `[DEMO-SPRINT-MVD] Maestro: Simple passing test`.\n3. **The \&quot;Future Polish \u0026 Content Blueprint\&quot; Section (CRITICAL):**\n    * In the **description of your PR** (or as a dedicated `NOTES.md` committed with the PR), create\n      a section:\n      ```markdown\n      ##  Future Polish \u0026 Content Blueprint \n\n      **1. Elevating to \&quot;Excellent\&quot; Demo:**\n      *   [ ] *e.g., Add assertions for all tab elements in Maestro.*\n      *   [ ] *e.g., Implement robust error handling for the native call.*\n\n      **2. Blog Post/Training Material Ideas:**\n      *   *e.g., Deep dive into AndroidManifest for deep link setup.*\n      *   *e.g., Explain MethodChannel argument types and return values.*\n      *   *e.g., Common pitfalls in JNIgen setup.*\n\n      **3. Code Refinements/Tech Debt Noted:**\n      *   *e.g., Refactor Flutter navigation service for better testability.*\n      *   *e.g., Kotlin function could be made more generic.*\n\n      **4. Open Questions/Explorations Deferred:**\n      *   *e.g., How does iOS handle this Flutter-to-native pattern?*\n      *   *e.g., Explore performance implications of FlutterFragment vs FlutterActivity.*\n      ```\n    * **Jot down notes here as you go or during Task 7.** This is how you capture brilliance without\n      slowing down the MVD.\n\n**B. For Claude (or other LLM) - Post-Sprint or for Asynchronous Assistance:**\n\n1. **Processing MVD PRs for Next Steps:**\n    * **Prompt:** \&quot;Claude, review PR `[link to MVD PR]` which achieved its Minimum Viable Demo.\n      Extract all items from its \u0027 Future Polish \u0026 Content Blueprint \u0027 section. Categorize them\n      and create a new GitHub issue titled \u0027Polish \u0026 Extend: [Original Feature Name]\u0027 with these\n      items as a checklist.\&quot;\n2. **Drafting Content Outlines:**\n    * **Prompt:** \&quot;Claude, using the MVD code from PR `[link]` and the \u0027Blog Post/Training Material\n      Ideas\u0027 from its \u0027Future Polish\u0027 section, draft a detailed outline for a blog post titled \u0027\n      Quick Start: [Feature Name] with Flutter \u0026 Native Integration\u0027. Include sections for\n      introduction, prerequisites, MVD walkthrough, and a \u0027Going Further\u0027 section based on the noted\n      ideas.\&quot;\n3. **Identifying Refactoring Tasks:**\n    * **Prompt:** \&quot;Claude, analyze the code in PR `[link]` and the \u0027Code Refinements\u0027 noted in its \u0027\n      Future Polish\u0027 section. Suggest 3 specific refactoring tasks, explain their benefits, and\n      provide a skeletal code structure for one of them.\&quot;\n4. **Generating Follow-up Stories/Tasks:**\n    * **Prompt:** \&quot;Claude, based on the \u0027Open Questions/Explorations Deferred\u0027 in these completed\n      MVD issues/PRs `[list links]`, generate a list of potential follow-up research spikes or\n      technical stories for our backlog.\&quot;\n\n**This dual approach (MVD focus now, structured notes for later) allows for high-speed, focused work\nin the timebox, while ensuring that valuable insights and next steps towards higher quality and\ncontent creation are not lost.**\n\n---\n\nLet\u0027s crush this 7-hour sprint! I\u0027m ready to assist as you move through these tasks.\n```&quot;},{&quot;role&quot;:&quot;assistant&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;\n\nNow let me look at the existing GitHub tickets to understand what needs to be split into milestones:&quot;}],&quot;tool_calls&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;toolu_bdrk_01MWp5UURPyZqAoXHLrKiBs1&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;function&quot;,&quot;function&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;list_dir&quot;,&quot;arguments&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;relative_workspace_path\&quot;: \&quot;github_tickets\&quot;, \&quot;explanation\&quot;: \&quot;Checking the GitHub tickets that need to be organized into milestones\&quot;}&quot;}}]},{&quot;role&quot;:&quot;tool&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;list_dir&quot;,&quot;tool_call_id&quot;:&quot;toolu_bdrk_01MWp5UURPyZqAoXHLrKiBs1&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;Contents of directory:\n\n[file] github_tickets/epic1_navigation.md (6.5KB, 162 lines) -

Integrate these bindings into my Flutter app:\n+   - Import the necessary files\n+   - Create a UI element (button) on the HomeScreen that calls this function\n+   - Display the result in a Text widget\n+   - Handle potential errors properly\n+\n+3. Test the integration:\n+   - How to verify it\u0027s working end-to-end\n+   - Troubleshooting tips if the call fails\n+\n+Please provide complete code samples and instructions for both the binding generation and Flutter implementation. The goal is to have a working demo where I can press a button in my Flutter app and see the result from the Kotlin function.\n```\n\nThe edit was successful with no linter errors.&quot;},{&quot;role&quot;:&quot;assistant&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;&quot;}],&quot;tool_calls&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;toolu_bdrk_01Rt6o58WrWxqgnDAs23k4p8&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;function&quot;,&quot;function&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;edit_file&quot;,&quot;arguments&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;target_file\&quot;: \&quot;milestones/milestone0.2/prompts/review_polish_prompt.txt\&quot;, \&quot;instructions\&quot;: \&quot;Creating LLM prompt for review and polish\&quot;, \&quot;code_edit\&quot;: \&quot;I\u0027ve completed the implementation of three Minimum Viable Demos (MVDs) for my Flutter project:\\n\\n1.
