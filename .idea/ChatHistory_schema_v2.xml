Sonnet\u0027s perspective, here are strategies for effectively utilizing AI systems for development tasks:\\n\\n### Strengths of Claude 3.7 Sonnet\\n- **Code Understanding**: Excels at comprehending complex codebases and multi-file relationships\\n- **Contextual Reasoning**: Strong ability to maintain context across long conversations\\n- **Technical Documentation**: Produces detailed, well-structured technical documentation\\n- **Problem-Solving**: Particularly effective at debugging and offering solutions to technical issues\\n- **Nuanced Responses**: Good at understanding implicit requirements and providing thoughtful solutions\\n\\n### Strengths of Gemini 2.5 Pro\\n- **Code Generation**: Often excels at generating concise, targeted code snippets\\n- **Real-Time Knowledge**: May have more recent training data for newer frameworks/libraries\\n- **Visual Input Processing**: Better handling of visual inputs like diagrams and screenshots\\n- **Structured Outputs**: Sometimes more consistent with structured data formats\\n- **UI/UX Design**: May provide stronger guidance on visual design patterns\\n\\n### When to Use Claude 3.7 Sonnet\\n- Complex system architecture design\\n- Debugging across multiple technologies\\n- Understanding intricate logic flows\\n- Tasks requiring careful reasoning about consequences\\n- Projects needing detailed technical documentation\\n- Cross-technology integration challenges\\n\\n### When to Use Gemini 2.5 Pro\\n- UI/UX focused development\\n- Tasks that benefit from visual input processing\\n- Generating boilerplate code\\n- Working with very recent frameworks or technologies\\n- Creating concise, targeted implementations\\n\\n### General Best Practices for AI Collaboration\\n\\n1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear context and specific requirements\\n   - Bad: \\\&quot;Help me with Flutter\\\&quot;\\n   - Good: \\\&quot;Help me implement a Flutter bottom navigation bar that can embed both Flutter and native views\\\&quot;\\n\\n2. **Iterate**: Start broad, then refine with follow-up questions\\n   - Initial: \\\&quot;How should I structure this hybrid app?\\\&quot;\\n   - Follow-up: \\\&quot;For the specific case of embedding Flutter in tab 3, what\u0027s the best approach?\\\&quot;\\n\\n3. **Provide Context**: Share relevant code, constraints, and dependencies\\n   - \\\&quot;Here\u0027s my current MainActivity.kt and how I\u0027m embedding Flutter...\\\&quot;\\n   - \\\&quot;We\u0027re using Flutter 3.10 with Android API level 33\\\&quot;\\n\\n4. **Break Down Complex Tasks**: Divide large problems into manageable chunks\\n   - Instead of \\\&quot;Build the whole app,\\\&quot; start with \\\&quot;Set up the project structure for a hybrid app\\\&quot;\\n\\n5. **Use Multiple Models**: Leverage different AIs for their respective strengths\\n   - Use Claude for architecture planning and integration strategies\\n   - Use Gemini for specific UI implementations or visual design\\n\\n6. **Validate Generated Content**: Always review and test AI suggestions\\n   - AIs may provide plausible-sounding but incorrect solutions\\n   - Test all code in your specific environment\\n\\n7. **Learn from the AI**: Ask for explanations, not just solutions\\n   - \\\&quot;Why did you structure the navigation this way?\\\&quot;\\n   - \\\&quot;What are the trade-offs of this approach?\\\&quot;\\n\\n8. **Prompt Engineering**: Learn to construct effective prompts\\n   - Include constraints, preferences, and format requirements\\n   - Specify the tone and level of detail needed\\n\\nRemember that while AI assistants like Claude and Gemini are powerful tools, they work best as collaborative partners rather than autonomous developers. The most effective approach is to leverage their strengths while applying your own judgment, domain knowledge, and testing rigor.\&quot;}&quot;}}]},{&quot;role&quot;:&quot;tool&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;edit_file&quot;,&quot;tool_call_id&quot;:&quot;toolu_bdrk_01Dyyvezc4PTK3843XEpVyex&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The apply model made the following changes to the file:\n\n```\n@@ -1,1 +1,79 @@\n+# General Strategy for Effective AI/LLM Utilization\n \n+## Choosing Between Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Gemini 2.5 Pro\n+\n+As observed from Claude 3.7 Sonnet\u0027s perspective, here are strategies for effectively utilizing AI\n+systems for development tasks:\n+\n+### Strengths of Claude 3.7 Sonnet\n+\n+- **Code Understanding**: Excels at comprehending complex codebases and multi-file relationships\n+- **Contextual Reasoning**: Strong ability to maintain context across long conversations\n+- **Technical Documentation**: Produces detailed, well-structured technical documentation\n+- **Problem-Solving**: Particularly effective at debugging and offering solutions to technical\n+  issues\n+- **Nuanced Responses**: Good at understanding implicit requirements and providing thoughtful\n+  solutions\n+\n+### Strengths of Gemini 2.5 Pro\n+\n+- **Code Generation**: Often excels at generating concise, targeted code snippets\n+- **Real-Time Knowledge**: May have more recent training data for newer frameworks/libraries\n+- **Visual Input Processing**: Better handling of visual inputs like diagrams and screenshots\n+- **Structured Outputs**: Sometimes more consistent with structured data formats\n+- **UI/UX Design**: May provide stronger guidance on visual design patterns\n+\n+### When to Use Claude 3.7 Sonnet\n+\n+- Complex system architecture design\n+- Debugging across multiple technologies\n+- Understanding intricate logic flows\n+- Tasks requiring careful reasoning about consequences\n+- Projects needing detailed technical documentation\n+- Cross-technology integration challenges\n+\n+### When to Use Gemini 2.5 Pro\n+\n+- UI/UX focused development\n+- Tasks that benefit from visual input processing\n+- Generating boilerplate code\n+- Working with very recent frameworks or technologies\n+- Creating concise, targeted implementations\n+\n+### General Best Practices for AI Collaboration\n+\n+1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear context and specific requirements\n+    - Bad: \&quot;Help me with Flutter\&quot;\n+    - Good: \&quot;Help me implement a Flutter bottom navigation bar that can embed both Flutter and\n+      native views\&quot;\n+\n+2. **Iterate**: Start broad, then refine with follow-up questions\n+    - Initial: \&quot;How should I structure this hybrid app?\&quot;\n+    - Follow-up: \&quot;For the specific case of embedding Flutter in tab 3, what\u0027s the best approach?\&quot;\n+\n+3. **Provide Context**: Share relevant code, constraints, and dependencies\n+    - \&quot;Here\u0027s my current MainActivity.kt and how I\u0027m embedding Flutter...\&quot;\n+    - \&quot;We\u0027re using Flutter 3.10 with Android API level 33\&quot;\n+\n+4. **Break Down Complex Tasks**: Divide large problems into manageable chunks\n+    - Instead of \&quot;Build the whole app,\&quot; start with \&quot;Set up the project structure for a hybrid app\&quot;\n+\n+5. **Use Multiple Models**: Leverage different AIs for their respective strengths\n+    - Use Claude for architecture planning and integration strategies\n+    - Use Gemini for specific UI implementations or visual design\n+\n+6. **Validate Generated Content**: Always review and test AI suggestions\n+    - AIs may provide plausible-sounding but incorrect solutions\n+    - Test all code in your specific environment\n+\n+7. **Learn from the AI**: Ask for explanations, not just solutions\n+    - \&quot;Why did you structure the navigation this way?\&quot;\n+    - \&quot;What are the trade-offs of this approach?\&quot;\n+\n+8. **Prompt Engineering**: Learn to construct effective prompts\n+    - Include constraints, preferences, and format requirements\n+    - Specify the tone and level of detail needed\n+\n+Remember that while AI assistants like Claude and Gemini are powerful tools, they work best as\n+collaborative partners rather than autonomous developers.

Build the Flutter web app with the correct base href:\n+   ```\n+\n+flutter build web --base-href /your-repo-name/\n+\n+   ```\n+\n+2. Navigate to the build output directory:\n+   ```\n+\n+cd build/web\n+\n+   ```\n+\n+3. Create a new git repository in the build directory:\n+   ```\n+\n+git init\n+git add .\n+git commit -m \&quot;Deploy to GitHub Pages\&quot;\n+\n+   ```\n+\n+4. Add your GitHub repository as a remote:\n+   ```\n+\n+git remote add origin https://github.com/username/your-repo-name.git\n+\n+   ```\n+\n+5. Push to the gh-pages branch:\n+   ```\n+\n+git push -f origin master:gh-pages\n+\n+   ```\n+\n+## Automated Deployment with GitHub Actions\n+\n+1. Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with the following content:\n+   ```yaml\n+   name: Deploy to GitHub Pages\n+\n+   on:\n+     push:\n+       branches: [ main ]\n+\n+   jobs:\n+     build:\n+       runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n+       steps:\n+         - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n+         - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v1\n+           with:\n+             flutter-version: \u00273.10.x\u0027\n+             channel: \u0027stable\u0027\n+         - run: flutter pub get\n+         - run: flutter build web --base-href /your-repo-name/\n+         - name: Deploy\n+           uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n+           with:\n+             github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n+             publish_dir: ./build/web\n+   ```\n+\n+2.

Memory management between Swift and Flutter requires careful attention\\n\\nDue to the limited Swift/iOS experience, expect significant time investment in understanding iOS architecture concepts and Flutter integration patterns. The Firebase App Distribution stretch goal adds complexity due to iOS code signing and provisioning requirements.\\n\\nKey differences from the Android version:\\n1. UIKit navigation stack vs Android\u0027s activity/fragment stack\\n2. Universal Links vs Android deep links\\n3. Different embedding mechanism for Flutter\\n4. iOS simulator-specific considerations\\n\\nThe focus on simulator testing will simplify development by avoiding device-specific issues and code signing requirements until the optional Firebase distribution step.\&quot;}&quot;}}]},{&quot;role&quot;:&quot;tool&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;edit_file&quot;,&quot;tool_call_id&quot;:&quot;toolu_bdrk_01A5UgcWn2qesB14yiMG9FEH&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The apply model made the following changes to the file:\n\n```\n@@ -1,1 +1,185 @@\n+# Epic: iOS-Flutter Hybrid Navigation App\n \n+## Summary (TLDR)\n+\n+**Create a hybrid iOS application demonstrating seamless navigation patterns between Swift and\n+Flutter views.**\n+\n+* **Core Tech**:\n+    * Flutter module embedded in Swift iOS app\n+    * **UIKit-based** navigation with FlutterViewController integration\n+* **Key Features**:\n+    * Bottom tab bar with 5 tabs (My, Billing, Dashboard, Items, ThTif)\n+    * Both **in-tab navigation** (tab bar visible) and **modal presentations** (tab bar hidden)\n+    * **Cross-technology transitions** in both directions (Flutter↔Swift)\n+    * **Deep linking** to specific screens using Universal Links\n+* **Primary Goal**: Demonstrate consistent navigation experience across technology boundaries\n+* **Optimization**: Focused on iOS Simulator experience for easier testing\n+* **Time Estimates**:\n+    * For developer with limited iOS/Swift experience: **80-100 hours**\n+    * For experienced iOS/Swift developer: **50-70 hours**\n+\n+## Description\n+\n+Implement a comprehensive hybrid application that combines native Swift and Flutter views with\n+sophisticated navigation patterns on iOS.

FlutterViewController lifecycle management is more complex than Android\u0027s FlutterActivity\n+3. Universal Links configuration requires proper entitlements and associated domains\n+4. Memory management between Swift and Flutter requires careful attention\n+\n+Due to the limited Swift/iOS experience, expect significant time investment in understanding iOS\n+architecture concepts and Flutter integration patterns. The Firebase App Distribution stretch goal\n+adds complexity due to iOS code signing and provisioning requirements.\n+\n+Key differences from the Android version:\n+\n+1. UIKit navigation stack vs Android\u0027s activity/fragment stack\n+2. Universal Links vs Android deep links\n+3. Different embedding mechanism for Flutter\n+4. iOS simulator-specific considerations\n+\n+The focus on simulator testing will simplify development by avoiding device-specific issues and code\n+signing requirements until the optional Firebase distribution step.\n```\n\nThe edit was successful with no linter errors.&quot;},{&quot;role&quot;:&quot;assistant&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;\n\nNow let\u0027s create a story for the iOS infrastructure setup:&quot;}],&quot;tool_calls&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;toolu_bdrk_015JjjDwbUPsL2wbxqvVG9wB&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;function&quot;,&quot;function&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;edit_file&quot;,&quot;arguments&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;target_file\&quot;: \&quot;github_tickets/story_ios_01_infrastructure.md\&quot;, \&quot;instructions\&quot;: \&quot;Creating the first story for iOS infrastructure setup\&quot;, \&quot;code_edit\&quot;: \&quot;# Story: Setup iOS-Flutter Hybrid App Infrastructure\\n\\n## Summary (TLDR)\\n\\n**Set up foundational infrastructure for combining Flutter and Swift in an iOS app.**\\n\\n* **Key Setup**:\\n  * Swift iOS project with UIKit tab bar controller\\n  * Flutter module properly embedded in iOS\\n  * FlutterEngine configuration and management\\n  * Method channels for basic Swift-Flutter communication\\n* **Goal**: Create working project structure optimized for iOS Simulator\\n* **Time Estimates**:\\n  * For developer with limited iOS/Swift experience: **15-20 hours**\\n  * For experienced iOS/Swift developer: **8-12 hours**\\n\\n## Description\\nSet up the foundational infrastructure for a hybrid Swift-Flutter application with a tab bar navigation.

Add rules to the `rules` array in `firebender.json` to specify guidelines.\n\nRules apply to **all** features of Firebender such as autocomplete, chat, and inline AI changes\nFirebender supports both project-specific rules and personal rules that apply across all projects.\nSee [Configuration Files](/context/configurations) for details on setting up personal rules.\n\nTo setup rules, you need to create a json file at the project root `firebender.json`.\n\n#### [​\n](#general-rules-example%3A-food-delivery-app)General Rules Example: Food delivery app\n\nIn `$projectRoot/firebender.json`:\n\nfirebender.json\n`{\n  \&quot;rules\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;Project is a food delivery app (Doordash)\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Never use runBlocking\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Don\u0026#x27;t hardcode dpi\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Use `@SerializedName` for data/retrofit classes because code gets obfuscated\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Follow Material Design 3 guidelines and components\&quot;,\n    \&quot;Use Kotlin coroutines and Flow for asynchronous operations\&quot;,\n  ]\n}\n`\n\n#### [​](#situational-rules-example%3A-test-files)Situational Rules Example: Test files\n\nHere’s an example situational rule:\n\nfirebender.json\n`{\n  \&quot;rules\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;Project is a food delivery app (Doordash)\&quot;,\n    {\n      \&quot;filePathMatches\&quot;: [\&quot;*Kotest.kt\&quot;],\n      \&quot;rules\&quot;: [\n        \&quot;Use Kotest framework/BDD for tests\&quot;\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n`\nIf you modify the file `ProfileViewModelKotest.kt`, AI will follow the rule `Use Kotest framework/BDD for tests`. If you modify `MainActivity.kt`, AI will not be provided the irrelevant rule.\n\n`filePathMatches` follows the same regex notation as typical line in `.gitignore`.\n\n#### [​](#full-file-rules)Full file rules\n\nFor complex or extensive rules, you can use external markdown files instead of embedding all rules in `firebender.json`. This solves several problems:\n\n- JSON has limitations for long strings\n\n- Projects often already have documentation (like `README.md` or `ARCHITECTURE.md`) that can be reused\n\n- Keeps rules organized and easier to maintain\n\nfirebender.json\n`{\n  \&quot;rules\&quot;: [\n    \&quot;Use Kotlin for all new code\&quot;,\n    {\n      \&quot;filePathMatches\&quot;: \&quot;**/*.kt\&quot;,\n      \&quot;rulesPaths\&quot;: \&quot;docs/architecture.md\&quot;\n    }\n  ]\n}\n`\nWith a corresponding `docs/architecture.md` file:\n\ndocs/architecture.md\n`# Android Architecture Guidelines\n\n## UI Layer\n- Use Jetpack Compose for new UI components\n- Follow Material Design 3 guidelines\n- Implement unidirectional data flow with ViewModels\n\n## Data Layer\n- Use Room for local database storage\n- Implement Repository pattern for data access\n- Use Retrofit for network operations\n`\nFirebender will include both inline rules and rules from the referenced external files when processing matching files.\n\n#### [​\n](#reading-errors)Reading Errors\n\nRules will use the latest file saved immediately. If there are parsing errors it will tell you which fields were incorrect:\n\nIn this case, `rules[0].filePathMatches` is supposed to be a `string` and not an `array`.\n\nFor a complete reference of the rules syntax including advanced patterns and configuration options, see the [Rules Syntax Documentation](https://docs.firebender.com/rules/syntax).\n\nWas this page helpful?\nYesNo[Configuration Files](/context/configurations)[Ignore Files](/context/ignore)On this page\n- [General Rules Example: Food delivery app](#general-rules-example%3A-food-delivery-app)\n- [Situational Rules Example: Test files](#situational-rules-example%3A-test-files)\n- [Full file rules](#full-file-rules)\n- [Reading Errors](#reading-errors)\n\n# https://docs.firehydrant.com/docs/markdown-support\n# Markdown Support | FireHydrant\n\nYou can use Markdown formatting to write structured content with FireHydrant.
