# AI Interactions Log - Branch 1

This file tracks AI interactions, prompts, and outcomes for development work on branch
1_flutter_integration.

## Session 1: Initial Flutter Setup

**Date**: 23-May-2025  
**Time**: 10:00 AM  
**AI Assistant**: Claude 4 Sonnet  
**Duration**: 30 minutes

### Initial Prompt

```
Please help me integrate a Flutter module into my existing Android app. 
I want to create a simple "Hello World" screen that can be accessed 
from a button in the Android app.
```

### Follow-up Prompts

- "The build is failing with dependency errors"
- "How do I fix the FlutterActivity import?"
- "Can you create a Maestro test for this?"

### Actions Taken

- Created Flutter module using `flutter create -t module`
- Updated Android project configuration
- Added menu button to launch Flutter screen
- Fixed import issues
- Created Maestro test

### Technical Challenges Encountered

1. **Dependency Resolution**: Flutter artifacts weren't built yet
2. **Import Issues**: FlutterActivity import couldn't be resolved automatically
3. **Repository Configuration**: Gradle conflicts between Android and Flutter

### Current Status

- ✅ Flutter module created
- ✅ Android integration configured
- ✅ Menu button added
- ⏳ Build issues being resolved
- ❌ Maestro test pending

### Next Steps

1. Resolve Flutter artifact dependencies
2. Complete Maestro test
3. Verify end-to-end functionality

### Lessons Learned

- Flutter integration requires careful Gradle setup
- Include approach needs Flutter SDK on all dev machines
- AI tools may struggle with complex import scenarios

### Code Changes Made

- `settings.gradle.kts`: Added Flutter module
- `MainActivity.kt`: Added menu handling
- `main_menu.xml`: Created menu resource

### Build Commands Executed

```bash
flutter create -t module flutter_module
./gradlew assembleDebug
flutter packages get
```

### Error Messages Encountered

```
Could not find io.flutter:flutter_embedding_debug:1.0.0-xyz
Build was configured to prefer settings repositories
```

## Session 2: Maestro Test Implementation

**Date**: 23-May-2025  
**Time**: 02:00 PM  
**AI Assistant**: Claude 4 Sonnet  
**Duration**: 25 minutes

### Prompts

```
Create a Maestro test that:
1. Launches the app
2. Taps the "TF" button in the app bar
3. Verifies "Hello World from Flutter!" text appears
4. Takes a screenshot for documentation
```

### Actions Taken

- Created `maestro/flows/flutter_hello_world.yaml`
- Implemented tap sequence for TF button
- Added text assertion for Flutter content
- Added screenshot capabilities
- Ran test and verified functionality

### Challenges

1. **Button Location**: TF button needed to be found by text
2. **Timing Issues**: Added wait for Flutter screen to load
3. **Text Assertion**: Ensured exact text match

### Status

- ✅ Maestro test created
- ✅ Test passes successfully
- ✅ Screenshots captured
- ✅ Documentation updated

### Next Steps

1. Add test to CI pipeline
2. Create additional test scenarios
3. Document test procedures

### Code Changes

- `maestro/flows/flutter_hello_world.yaml`: New test file

### Commands

```bash
maestro test maestro/flows/flutter_hello_world.yaml
```
