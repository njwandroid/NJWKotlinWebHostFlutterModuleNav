# GitHub Tickets: Jira Integration Tools

## Ticket #1: Claude Desktop Quick Setup for Jira Beginners

### Title

**Setup Claude Desktop in 15 Minutes for Jira Ticket Management (Beginner-Friendly)**

### Labels

`enhancement`, `documentation`, `good-first-issue`, `jira`, `claude`

### Priority

**High**

### Description

Create a 15-minute setup guide that enables someone completely new to Jira (and intimidated by it)
to use Claude Desktop for searching, filtering, and creating Jira tickets.

### Problem Statement

- New team members are intimidated by Jira's complex interface
- Creating tickets requires learning Jira's specific workflows and fields
- Searching and filtering tickets is confusing for beginners
- Context switching between development tools and Jira slows productivity

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Must Have

- [ ] **Quick Start Guide**: Step-by-step setup taking ≤15 minutes
- [ ] **Claude Desktop MCP Configuration**: Pre-configured for Jira API access
- [ ] **Natural Language Interface**: Users can say "Create a bug ticket for login issue" instead of
  filling forms
- [ ] **Smart Search**: Users can ask "Find all tickets assigned to me this sprint"
- [ ] **Template System**: Pre-built templates for common ticket types (bug, feature, story)
- [ ] **Jira Field Mapping**: Automatic mapping of natural language to Jira fields

#### Nice to Have

- [ ] **Jira Terminology Translation**: Convert Jira jargon to plain English
- [ ] **Context Suggestions**: Suggest relevant projects/components based on current work
- [ ] **Bulk Operations**: Create multiple related tickets from single description

### Technical Requirements

#### Prerequisites

- Jira Cloud instance with API access
- Claude Desktop installed
- Basic authentication token or OAuth setup

#### Implementation Approach

1. **MCP Server Development**
   ```typescript
   // Jira MCP Server capabilities
   - jira.search(query: string)
   - jira.create(ticket: TicketRequest)
   - jira.update(ticketId: string, updates: Partial<Ticket>)
   - jira.getMyTickets(filters?: FilterOptions)
   ```

2. **Natural Language Processing**
    - Parse user requests like "Create bug ticket: Login button doesn't work on mobile"
    - Extract ticket type, summary, description, priority from natural language
    - Map to appropriate Jira fields

3. **Beginner-Friendly Templates**
   ```markdown
   # Bug Report Template
   - What were you trying to do?
   - What went wrong?
   - What browser/device were you using?
   - How urgent is this? (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   ```

### User Stories

#### As a New Developer

> "I want to create a Jira ticket by describing the problem in plain English, without learning
Jira's interface"

#### As a Product Manager

> "I want to quickly search for tickets related to a feature without memorizing JQL syntax"

#### As a Team Lead

> "I want new team members to be productive with ticket management on day one"

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Documentation tested with 3 Jira beginners
- [ ] Setup time verified to be ≤15 minutes
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Error handling for common authentication issues
- [ ] Screenshots and video walkthrough included

### Estimated Effort

**8-12 hours** (2-3 days for experienced developer)

## Ticket #3: VSCode Extension for Jira Integration

### Title

**VSCode Extension: GitHub Copilot/Windsurf Integration for Jira Ticket Management**

### Labels

`enhancement`, `vscode`, `copilot`, `windsurf`, `jira`, `productivity`

### Priority

**Medium**

### Description

Create a VSCode extension that enables GitHub Copilot and Windsurf to create and update Jira tickets
directly from the development environment using natural language commands and context awareness.

### Problem Statement

- Context switching between IDE and Jira breaks development flow
- Developers forget to update ticket status during development
- Manual ticket creation is time-consuming and error-prone
- Lack of integration between AI coding assistants and project management

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Core Features

- [ ] **Natural Language Commands**: Create tickets using comments like
  `// TODO: Create Jira ticket for refactoring this function`
- [ ] **AI Assistant Integration**: Works seamlessly with GitHub Copilot and Windsurf
- [ ] **Context-Aware Creation**: Automatically includes relevant code context, file paths, and
  project information
- [ ] **Status Synchronization**: Update ticket status based on code changes and commits
- [ ] **Quick Actions**: Hover actions and command palette integration

#### Copilot Integration

- [ ] **Smart Suggestions**: Copilot suggests creating tickets for complex refactoring or bug fixes
- [ ] **Template Completion**: Copilot completes Jira ticket templates based on code context
- [ ] **Automatic Linking**: Link code changes to existing tickets automatically

#### Windsurf Integration

- [ ] **Project Context**: Leverage Windsurf's project understanding for better ticket context
- [ ] **Multi-file Awareness**: Create tickets that span multiple files or components
- [ ] **Architecture Insights**: Generate tickets for architectural improvements identified by
  Windsurf

### Technical Implementation

#### VSCode Extension API Usage

```typescript
// Extension activation and command registration
export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
  // Register commands
  const createTicketCommand = vscode.commands.registerCommand(
    'jira-integration.createTicket',
    createTicketFromSelection
  );
  
  // Register code lens provider for TODO comments
  const codeLensProvider = new JiraCodeLensProvider();
  vscode.languages.registerCodeLensProvider('*', codeLensProvider);
  
  // Register hover provider for ticket links
  const hoverProvider = new JiraHoverProvider();
  vscode.languages.registerHoverProvider('*', hoverProvider);
}
```

#### AI Assistant Integration

```typescript
interface AIAssistantIntegration {
  // Copilot integration
  registerCopilotSuggestions(): void
  processInlineCompletion(suggestion: string): Promise<JiraTicketSuggestion>
  
  // Windsurf integration  
  registerWindsurfContext(): void
  processProjectAnalysis(analysis: ProjectAnalysis): Promise<TicketRecommendation[]>
}
```

#### Natural Language Processing

```typescript
interface TicketParser {
  parseComment(comment: string): TicketRequest | null
  extractContext(document: vscode.TextDocument, range: vscode.Range): CodeContext
  generateDescription(context: CodeContext, userInput: string): string
}

// Example usage:
// "// TODO: Create bug ticket - Login form validation is broken on Safari"
// Parses to: { type: 'bug', summary: 'Login form validation broken on Safari', context: {...} }
```

### User Experience Flow

#### Scenario 1: Quick Ticket Creation

1. Developer writes: `// TODO: Refactor this function - it's too complex`
2. Extension shows code lens: "📝 Create Jira Ticket"
3. Click opens quick input with pre-filled template
4. One-click creation with automatic context inclusion

#### Scenario 2: Copilot Suggestion

1. Copilot suggests complex code change
2. Extension detects complexity and suggests: "This change might need a tracking ticket"
3. Developer accepts suggestion
4. Extension creates ticket with Copilot's suggested approach as description

#### Scenario 3: Status Updates

1. Developer commits code with message: "Fix login validation issue"
2. Extension detects related Jira ticket
3. Automatically updates ticket status and adds commit link

### Configuration Options

#### User Settings

```json
{
  "jira-integration.server": "https://company.atlassian.net",
  "jira-integration.defaultProject": "DEV",
  "jira-integration.autoCreateFromTodos": true,
  "jira-integration.copilotIntegration": true,
  "jira-integration.windsurfIntegration": true,
  "jira-integration.autoStatusUpdates": true

  issueType: string
  fields: {
    summary: string
    description: string
    priority: string
    assignee?: string
    components?: string[]
  }
  triggers: string[] // Comment patterns that trigger this template
}
