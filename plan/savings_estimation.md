# Savings Estimation

## Estimated Savings with LLMs and Firebender

This document outlines potential time and frustration savings by effectively using LLMs (Large
Language Models) and Firebender across the project, individual epics, and the first three user
stories.

### Overall Project

* **Estimated Total Hours for Project (Baseline - without significant AI assist):** Assuming a
  medium-sized project based on the number of epics and stories, let's estimate 800-1200 hours.
* **Potential Time Saved (Hours):** 160 - 360 hours
* **Potential Time Saved (%):** 20-30%
* **Potential Frustration Reduction:** High (e.g., reducing repetitive tasks, accelerating research,
  aiding in debugging, boilerplate code generation). Could reduce overall project frustration from a
  hypothetical 6/10 to 3/10.
* **Key Areas for LLM/Firebender Application:**
    * Code generation (boilerplate, data models, simple functions).
    * Documentation drafting (READMEs, API docs, comments).
    * Test case generation (unit, integration, UI tests with Maestro).
    * Debugging assistance (analyzing logs, suggesting fixes).
    * Research and learning (new technologies, best practices).
    * Code refactoring and optimization suggestions.
    * Generating reports and summaries from technical inputs.

### Per Epic

Estimates per epic assume varying levels of complexity and applicability of AI tools.

**1. Epic 1: Navigation (`epic1_navigation.md`)**
*   **Estimated Hours (Baseline):** 80-120 hours
*   **Potential Time Saved (Hours):** 15-30 hours
*   **Potential Time Saved (%):** 15-25%
*   **Potential Frustration Reduction:** Medium. Navigation logic can be complex and error-prone. AI
can help with routing logic, state management, and testing.
*   **Key Areas:** Generating navigation boilerplate, suggesting routing patterns, writing tests for
navigation flows.

**2. Epic 2: Web Deployment (`epic2_web_deployment.md`)**
*   **Estimated Hours (Baseline):** 100-150 hours
*   **Potential Time Saved (Hours):** 20-45 hours
*   **Potential Time Saved (%):** 20-30%
*   **Potential Frustration Reduction:** High. Deployment can involve many finicky configuration
steps. AI can help with CI/CD pipeline scripts, Dockerfiles, and troubleshooting deployment issues.
*   **Key Areas:** Generating deployment scripts, infrastructure-as-code templates, documentation
for deployment processes.

**3. Epic 3: Platform Communication (`epic3_platform_communication.md`)**
*   **Estimated Hours (Baseline):** 120-180 hours
*   **Potential Time Saved (Hours):** 30-50 hours
*   **Potential Time Saved (%):** 25-30%
*   **Potential Frustration Reduction:** High. Platform channels/native communication can be tricky.
AI can help generate method channel boilerplate, data serialization/deserialization, and error
handling.
*   **Key Areas:** Generating FFI/Pigeon boilerplate, type definitions, handling asynchronous calls
between Flutter and native code.

**4. Epic 4: iOS Navigation (`epic4_ios_navigation.md`)**
*   **Estimated Hours (Baseline):** 80-120 hours (similar to general navigation but
platform-specific)
*   **Potential Time Saved (Hours):** 15-30 hours
*   **Potential Time Saved (%):** 15-25%
*   **Potential Frustration Reduction:** Medium. iOS-specific navigation quirks.
*   **Key Areas:** Swift/Objective-C code snippets for native navigation components if needed,
adapting existing navigation logic for iOS specifics.

**5. Epic 5: Maestro Testing (`epic5_maestro_testing.md`)**
*   **Estimated Hours (Baseline):** 60-100 hours (for comprehensive test suite development)
*   **Potential Time Saved (Hours):** 20-40 hours
*   **Potential Time Saved (%):** 30-40%
*   **Potential Frustration Reduction:** High. Writing UI tests can be repetitive. AI can draft test
flows from descriptions or existing code. The example story `story_maestro_00_setup_and_demo.md`
already shows high LOE with Firebender.
*   **Key Areas:** Generating Maestro YAML flows, identifying UI elements, creating test assertions,
generating demo materials from test outputs.

### First Three Stories

**1. Story 01: Skeleton Infrastructure (`story_01_skeleton_infrastructure.md`)**
*   **Estimated Hours (Baseline):** 20-30 hours
*   **Potential Time Saved (Hours):** 5-10 hours
*   **Potential Time Saved (%):** 25-33%
*   **Potential Frustration Reduction:** Medium. Setting up project structure, basic configurations.
AI can speed this up.
*   **Key Areas:** Generating folder structures, basic config files, initial CI setup scripts.

**2. Story 02: My Tab Implementation (`story_02_my_tab_implementation.md`)**
*   **Estimated Hours (Baseline):** 15-25 hours
*   **Potential Time Saved (Hours):** 4-8 hours
*   **Potential Time Saved (%):** 25-32%
*   **Potential Frustration Reduction:** Medium. UI component creation and basic logic.
*   **Key Areas:** Generating Flutter widget code, basic state management, unit tests for the tab
logic.

**3. Story 03: Billing Tab Implementation (`story_03_billing_tab_implementation.md`)**
*   **Estimated Hours (Baseline):** 15-25 hours
*   **Potential Time Saved (Hours):** 4-8 hours
*   **Potential Time Saved (%):** 25-32%
*   **Potential Frustration Reduction:** Medium. Similar to "My Tab", potentially with more complex
forms or data display.
*   **Key Areas:** UI for billing information, form handling, data display widgets.

---
**Disclaimer:** These are speculative estimates. Actual savings will depend on the specific tasks,
the skill of the developers in using AI tools, and the nature of the AI tools themselves. Consistent
logging of AI interactions and outcomes (as initiated in `ai_interactions.log`) will help refine
these estimates over time.
