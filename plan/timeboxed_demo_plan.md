# Timeboxed 7-Hour Focused Demo Sprint Plan

**Overall Goal:** Achieve demonstrable progress on three key areas: a simple Maestro UI test, core
navigation patterns (including native-Flutter interplay, deep links, and backstack for Android &
Web), and a basic JNIgen example for native Kotlin API calls, all within a 7-hour focused effort. *
*This plan assumes preparatory research is complete, and focuses on execution.**

**Your Mindset (Life Coach Corner!):** You've got this! With research done, it's all about focused
execution. Embrace the sprint: intensity, quick wins, and tangible results. "Good enough" for the
demo is the immediate win; we'll lay tracks for "excellent" as we go. Stay energized with those
planned breaks!

## ‚≠ê Managing GitHub Issues & PRs: From Quick Wins to Lasting Excellence ‚≠ê

This sprint is about speed and MVDs. But we want to build towards excellence. Here's how to manage
your Git workflow and use an LLM like Claude effectively:

**A. For You (The Human Developer) - During the Sprint:**

1. **Issue per Task/MVD:** Create a simple GitHub issue for each major task (e.g., "MVD: Maestro
   Simple Demo," "MVD: Android <-> Flutter Nav").
    * **Checklist for MVD:** Clearly list the 2-3 absolute minimum criteria for the demo to be "
      done" for this sprint.
2. **Small, Focused PRs for MVDs:**
    * Branch for each issue (e.g., `feature/mvd-maestro-demo`).
    * Submit a PR when the MVD checklist for that issue is met.
    * **PR Title:** `[DEMO-SPRINT-MVD] Maestro: Simple passing test`.
3. **The "Future Polish & Content Blueprint" Section (CRITICAL):**
    * In the **description of your PR** (or as a dedicated `NOTES.md` committed with the PR), create
      a section:
      ```markdown
      ## üöÄ Future Polish & Content Blueprint üöÄ

      **1. Elevating to "Excellent" Demo:**
      *   [ ] *e.g., Add assertions for all tab elements in Maestro.*
      *   [ ] *e.g., Implement robust error handling for the native call.*

      **2. Blog Post/Training Material Ideas:**
      *   *e.g., Deep dive into AndroidManifest for deep link setup.*
      *   *e.g., Explain MethodChannel argument types and return values.*
      *   *e.g., Common pitfalls in JNIgen setup.*

      **3. Code Refinements/Tech Debt Noted:**
      *   *e.g., Refactor Flutter navigation service for better testability.*
      *   *e.g., Kotlin function could be made more generic.*

      **4. Open Questions/Explorations Deferred:**
      *   *e.g., How does iOS handle this Flutter-to-native pattern?*
      *   *e.g., Explore performance implications of FlutterFragment vs FlutterActivity.*
      ```
    * **Jot down notes here as you go or during Task 7.** This is how you capture brilliance without
      slowing down the MVD.

**B. For Claude (or other LLM) - Post-Sprint or for Asynchronous Assistance:**

1. **Processing MVD PRs for Next Steps:**
    * **Prompt:** "Claude, review PR `[link to MVD PR]` which achieved its Minimum Viable Demo.
      Extract all items from its 'üöÄ Future Polish & Content Blueprint üöÄ' section. Categorize them
      and create a new GitHub issue titled 'Polish & Extend: [Original Feature Name]' with these
      items as a checklist."
2. **Drafting Content Outlines:**
    * **Prompt:** "Claude, using the MVD code from PR `[link]` and the 'Blog Post/Training Material
      Ideas' from its 'Future Polish' section, draft a detailed outline for a blog post titled '
      Quick Start: [Feature Name] with Flutter & Native Integration'. Include sections for
      introduction, prerequisites, MVD walkthrough, and a 'Going Further' section based on the noted
      ideas."
3. **Identifying Refactoring Tasks:**
    * **Prompt:** "Claude, analyze the code in PR `[link]` and the 'Code Refinements' noted in its '
      Future Polish' section. Suggest 3 specific refactoring tasks, explain their benefits, and
      provide a skeletal code structure for one of them."
4. **Generating Follow-up Stories/Tasks:**
    * **Prompt:** "Claude, based on the 'Open Questions/Explorations Deferred' in these completed
      MVD issues/PRs `[list links]`, generate a list of potential follow-up research spikes or
      technical stories for our backlog."

**This dual approach (MVD focus now, structured notes for later) allows for high-speed, focused work
in the timebox, while ensuring that valuable insights and next steps towards higher quality and
content creation are not lost.**
