# Story: Implement ThTif Tab with Complex Cross-Technology Navigation

## Summary (TLDR)

**Create the most complex navigation showcase with multiple cross-technology transitions.**

* **Key Features**:
  * Flutter view with title "To Host Then Inner Flutter"
  * **"To Host" button**: Navigates from Flutter to Kotlin view
  * **"To Inner Flutter View" button**: Navigates to another Flutter view
  * Both in-tab and full-screen navigation patterns
* **Technical Focus**:
  * Complex backstack behavior across multiple technology transitions
  * Maintaining consistent user experience in multi-level navigation
* **Time Estimate**: 10-14 hours

## Description

Implement the "ThTif" tab as a Flutter view with advanced navigation capabilities that demonstrate
complex cross-technology navigation patterns, including Flutter-to-Kotlin and Flutter-to-Flutter
navigation.

## Requirements

- Implement ThTif tab as a Flutter view with title "To Host Then Inner Flutter"
- Add "To Host" button that navigates to a native Kotlin view
- Add "To Inner Flutter View" button that navigates to another Flutter view
- Demonstrate both in-tab and full-screen navigation variants
- Ensure clean backstack behavior across all navigation scenarios

## Technical Tasks

- [ ] Create the main ThTif tab UI in Flutter with proper title
- [ ] Implement "To Host" button that navigates to a Kotlin view
- [ ] Implement "To Inner Flutter View" button that navigates to another Flutter view
- [ ] Create the target Kotlin view with appropriate UI and navigation options
- [ ] Create the target Inner Flutter view with appropriate UI and navigation options
- [ ] Implement navigation logic for both buttons
- [ ] Configure proper backstack behavior for all navigation paths
- [ ] Add appropriate transition animations between views
- [ ] Implement state preservation when returning to ThTif tab

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] ThTif tab displays correctly with title "To Host Then Inner Flutter"
- [ ] "To Host" button navigates to a Kotlin view
- [ ] "To Inner Flutter View" button navigates to another Flutter view
- [ ] Back button works correctly in all scenarios, following a logical backstack
- [ ] State is preserved when returning to ThTif tab
- [ ] No visual glitches during transitions
- [ ] Complex navigation sequences work correctly (e.g., ThTif → Host → ThTif → Inner Flutter →
  ThTif)

## Notes

This story demonstrates the most complex navigation patterns in the application, serving as a
showcase of cross-technology navigation capabilities. It should be implemented with special
attention to backstack behavior and state preservation.

### Notes

This story presents the most complex navigation challenges in the entire application:

1. Multiple navigation paths involving both Flutter and Kotlin
2. Need to maintain a coherent backstack across technology boundaries
3. Complex state management when navigating through multiple views

The biggest challenge will be ensuring a consistent user experience when performing complex
navigation sequences like ThTif → Host → ThTif → Inner Flutter → ThTif. This requires careful
coordination between Android's backstack and Flutter's navigation system.

Edge cases to test include:

1. Rapid navigation between views
2. Device rotation during navigation
3. App backgrounding and restoration mid-navigation flow
4. Deep linking into any part of this navigation flow

Consider implementing a navigation coordinator pattern to centralize navigation logic and ensure
consistency.
