## Description

Deploy the hybrid Flutter-Kotlin application to the web platform with minimal code modifications,
allowing the same navigation patterns to be demonstrated through a web browser. This epic focuses on
leveraging Flutter's web capabilities while accommodating a developer with minimal web knowledge.

## Core Requirements

- Configure Flutter project for web platform support
- Ensure navigation patterns work consistently in web environment
- Create a simple demonstration environment using index.html and flutter_run_chrome
- Deploy the application to GitHub Pages for public access
- Provide clear documentation for both demo and deployment processes

## Subtasks

### 1. Web Platform Configuration

- [ ] Configure Flutter project for web support
- [ ] Set up web-specific assets and configurations
- [ ] Implement web entry point and bootstrap process
- [ ] Handle platform-specific dependencies
- [ ] Test basic Flutter widget rendering in browser

### 2. Navigation Adaptation for Web

- [ ] Analyze existing navigation code for web compatibility
- [ ] Implement minimal modifications to support web navigation
- [ ] Handle browser history and back button behavior
- [ ] Adapt deep linking to use URL fragments/query parameters
- [ ] Create web-specific navigation helpers if needed

### 3. Demo Environment Setup

- [ ] Create index.html entry point for web demonstration
- [ ] Configure flutter_run_chrome for local development
- [ ] Implement demo flow showcasing all navigation patterns
- [ ] Create step-by-step demo guide
- [ ] Test demo flow across different browsers

### 4. GitHub Pages Deployment

- [ ] Configure project for GitHub Pages compatibility
- [ ] Set up automated build process
- [ ] Create deployment scripts
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline for automatic deployments
- [ ] Document the deployment process

### 5. Documentation and Testing

- [ ] Create comprehensive web deployment documentation
- [ ] Document any platform-specific considerations
- [ ] Test across multiple browsers and devices
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Document performance optimization techniques

## Technical Considerations

- Flutter web rendering mode selection (HTML vs CanvasKit)
- Web-specific performance optimizations
- Browser compatibility considerations
- Asset loading and caching strategies
- Web-specific navigation patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Flutter application runs correctly in web browsers
- [ ] All navigation patterns from the mobile app work in web environment
- [ ] Demo can be easily launched using provided instructions
- [ ] Application is successfully deployed to GitHub Pages
- [ ] Documentation covers all aspects of demo and deployment
- [ ] Navigation experience is consistent between mobile and web

### Notes

This epic involves adapting the hybrid app for web deployment, which presents unique challenges:

1. The Flutter developer has minimal web knowledge, which may increase the learning curve
2. Web navigation differs fundamentally from mobile navigation patterns
3. Flutter web support, while improving, still has platform-specific considerations
4. GitHub Pages deployment requires specific configuration

The good news is that Flutter's cross-platform nature means much of the navigation code should work
with minimal modifications. The focus should be on proper web configuration and handling
web-specific navigation behaviors like browser history and URL patterns.

Expect to spend more time on web-specific configuration and deployment than on adapting the actual
navigation code. The GitHub Pages deployment may require several iterations to get right, especially
for developers new to web deployment.
