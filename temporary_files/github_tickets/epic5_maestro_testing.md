# Epic: Maestro UI Testing Integration

## Summary (TLDR)

* **Purpose**: Implement comprehensive UI testing using Maestro for our hybrid Flutter-Kotlin
  navigation app
* **Key Components**: Test infrastructure setup, automated test flows, CI/CD integration, video
  capture, and analytics
* **Focus Areas**: Navigation testing, deep linking validation, cross-platform compatibility
* **Deliverables**: Working test suite, GitHub Actions integration, demo videos, and AI test
  analysis

## Background

Our hybrid Flutter-Kotlin navigation app requires thorough UI testing to ensure consistent behavior
across platforms and between native and Flutter components. Maestro provides an excellent solution
with its YAML-based test flows that can interact with both Flutter and native elements seamlessly.

## Goals

- Create a maintainable Maestro test suite for the app
- Automate UI testing as part of our CI/CD pipeline
- Generate visual evidence of app functionality (screenshots/videos)
- Use AI-powered analysis to identify potential UI/UX issues
- Deploy tests to a cloud-based testing service for broader device coverage

## Non-Goals

- Replacing unit and integration tests
- Testing backend API functionality directly
- Performance testing (this will be handled in a separate epic)
- Security testing (this will be handled by a separate epic)

## User Stories/Tasks

### Story: Maestro Infrastructure Setup

- Set up Maestro locally for the development team
- Create initial directory structure and documentation
- Implement a failing "Hello World" test to validate setup
- Add Maestro to developer onboarding documentation

### Story: Basic Navigation Testing

- Create flows for testing bottom navigation bar functionality
- Test navigation between Flutter and Kotlin screens
- Validate back stack behavior for in-tab and out-of-tab navigation
- Ensure consistent navigation patterns work across the app

### Story: Deep Linking Validation

- Test deep linking to specific screens within the app
- Validate navigation state after following deep links
- Test sharing deep links and returning to the app

### Story: Cross-Platform Testing

- Adapt test flows to work on both Android and iOS
- Document platform-specific considerations
- Create flows specifically for testing platform-specific UI behaviors

### Story: CI/CD Integration with GitHub Actions

- Set up GitHub Actions workflow for Maestro tests
- Configure tests to run on pull requests
- Generate test reports and artifacts
- Add status checks for PR approval based on tests

### Story: AI Analysis of Test Results

- Research options for AI-powered UI/UX analysis
- Implement a spike solution to analyze screenshot patterns
- Generate reports highlighting potential UX issues
- Create a feedback loop from AI analysis to design team

### Story: Video Recording and Sharing

- Configure Maestro to record test execution videos
- Set up storage and sharing of test videos
- Create demo videos showcasing app functionality
- Use videos for team reviews and stakeholder presentations

### Story: Cloud Testing Service Integration

- Research free open source testing services (e.g., Browserstack, TestingBot)
- Set up integration with selected service
- Configure cloud testing as part of the CI/CD pipeline
- Document the cloud testing workflow

### Story: Maestro Demo and Pitch Creation

- Create comprehensive demo of Maestro testing capabilities
- Develop a Loom presentation showcasing the testing setup
- Prepare materials for internal team knowledge transfer
- Document ROI and benefits of Maestro for stakeholders

## Technical Details

- Maestro tests will be written in YAML and stored in the `maestro/flows` directory
- Tests should be organized by feature area (navigation, deep linking, etc.)
- CI integration will use GitHub Actions with matrix testing for multiple device profiles
- Video recordings will be stored as artifacts in GitHub Actions

## Dependencies

- Flutter app components must have proper test IDs for reliable selection
- Native Kotlin screens must expose accessibility labels
- Proper device/emulator setup in the CI environment
- Access to cloud testing service API keys

## Acceptance Criteria

- All key user journeys have automated Maestro tests
- Tests run successfully on both Android and iOS
- GitHub Actions workflow successfully executes tests on PRs
- Test report artifacts are generated and accessible
- Demo video and presentation materials are created
- Test failures provide clear, actionable information

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk**: Flaky tests due to timing issues
  **Mitigation**: Implement proper waiting strategies and timeouts

- **Risk**: Different behavior between local and CI environments
  **Mitigation**: Standardize device profiles and ensure consistent app state

- **Risk**: Maintenance overhead as app UI evolves
  **Mitigation**: Focus tests on critical paths, use resilient selectors

## AI Assistance Analysis
