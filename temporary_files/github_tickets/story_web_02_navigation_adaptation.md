# Story: Adapt Navigation Patterns for Web Platform

## Summary (TLDR)

**Adapt existing navigation system for web browser environment with minimal changes.**

* **Key Tasks**:
    * Implement **browser history API integration**
    * Convert deep linking to use URL parameters/fragments
    * Handle browser back button correctly
    * Manage state across page refreshes
* **Technical Focus**:
    * Maintaining consistent navigation experience between mobile and web
    * Preserving all navigation patterns while adapting to browser environment
* **Time Estimate**: 8-10 hours

## Description

Implement minimal modifications to the existing navigation system to ensure all navigation patterns
work correctly in the web environment. Focus on handling browser-specific navigation behaviors like
history, back button, and URL-based deep linking.

## Requirements

- Ensure all navigation patterns from mobile app work in web environment
- Implement browser history integration
- Handle back button behavior correctly in web context
- Adapt deep linking to use URL fragments or query parameters
- Create web-specific navigation helpers if needed

## Technical Tasks

- [ ] Analyze existing navigation code for web compatibility issues
- [ ] Implement browser history API integration
- [ ] Modify deep linking system to use URL parameters/fragments
- [ ] Create web router configuration to handle URL-based navigation
- [ ] Implement path-based routing for web-specific navigation
- [ ] Test all navigation patterns in web browsers
- [ ] Handle browser refresh behavior appropriately
- [ ] Ensure navigation state persistence across page reloads

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All tabs are accessible and function correctly in web environment
- [ ] Navigation between screens works correctly
- [ ] Browser back button behaves as expected, following app navigation history
- [ ] Deep links via URLs correctly navigate to appropriate screens
- [ ] Page refresh maintains current navigation state when possible
- [ ] All cross-technology navigation patterns work in web context
- [ ] No visual glitches during navigation transitions

## Notes

This story focuses on adapting the navigation system to work correctly in the web environment. The
goal is to make minimal changes to the existing navigation code while ensuring proper web behavior.

### Notes

For a Flutter developer with minimal web knowledge, adapting navigation for web presents several
challenges:

1. Understanding browser history API and its integration with Flutter
2. Handling URL-based navigation instead of screen-based navigation
3. Managing page refresh behavior which doesn't exist in mobile apps

Key strategies for success:

- Consider using a routing package like go_router that handles web navigation well
- Implement a routing abstraction layer to minimize changes to existing code
- Test thoroughly with different browser navigation patterns

The good news is that the core Flutter navigation code can remain largely unchanged if properly
abstracted. The main work will be in:

1. Adding browser history integration
2. Converting deep link formats to URL patterns
3. Handling URL parsing for route parameters

Focus on maintaining a consistent user experience between mobile and web, even if the underlying
implementation differs significantly.
