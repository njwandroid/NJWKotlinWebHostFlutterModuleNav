### Notes

For a Flutter developer with minimal web knowledge, creating comprehensive documentation is crucial
for long-term success. The main challenges will be:

1. Identifying and documenting all platform-specific behaviors
2. Testing across a wide range of browsers and devices
3. Creating troubleshooting guidance for web-specific issues

# Web Platform Documentation

## Architecture Overview
- Flutter web rendering pipeline
- Platform detection implementation
- Navigation system adaptations for web

## Browser Compatibility
| Browser | Version | Basic Rendering | Navigation | Deep Linking | Notes |
|---------|---------|-----------------|------------|--------------|-------|
| Chrome  | Latest  | ✅              | ✅         | ✅           |       |
| Firefox | Latest  | ✅              | ✅         | ✅           |       |
| Safari  | Latest  | ✅              | ✅         | ✅           |       |
| Edge    | Latest  | ✅              | ✅         | ✅           |       |
| Mobile Chrome | Latest | ✅         | ✅         | ✅           |       |
| Mobile Safari | Latest | ✅         | ✅         | ✅           |       |

## Performance Optimization
- Choice of renderer (HTML vs CanvasKit)
- Asset optimization strategies
- Deferred loading techniques
- State management considerations

## Known Limitations
- SPA navigation limitations with GitHub Pages
- Plugin compatibility issues
- Browser-specific quirks

## Troubleshooting Guide
- 404 errors on page refresh
- Asset loading failures
- Navigation history issues
- Rendering inconsistencies between browsers
```

The testing effort should include creating a test matrix that covers all navigation patterns across
different browsers and devices. Consider using browser developer tools to simulate different devices
when physical testing isn't feasible.
