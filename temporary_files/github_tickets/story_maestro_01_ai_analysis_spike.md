# Story: AI Analysis Spike for Maestro Testing

## Summary (TLDR)

* **Purpose**: Research and implement a proof-of-concept for AI-powered analysis of Maestro UI test
  results
* **Key Activities**: Evaluate AI tools for analyzing screenshots, develop prototype for detecting
  UI inconsistencies
* **Deliverables**: Working prototype script, documented approach, sample analysis of test results
* **Outcome**: Recommendations for full implementation in production testing pipeline

## Description

As part of our Maestro UI testing initiative, we want to leverage AI capabilities to analyze test
results automatically. This spike will explore using AI to analyze screenshots generated during
Maestro test runs to identify UI inconsistencies, visual regressions, accessibility issues, and UX
problems that might not be caught by traditional assertion-based testing.

## Tasks

1. **Research Phase**
    - Research available AI tools and services for image analysis (e.g., Google Cloud Vision, AWS
      Rekognition, Azure Computer Vision)
    - Investigate open-source libraries for image comparison and analysis
    - Review existing solutions for AI-based UI testing analysis
    - Document findings and recommend approach

2. **Prototype Development**
    - Set up a basic integration with selected AI service/library
    - Develop script to analyze Maestro screenshot output directory
    - Create comparison logic to detect visual changes between test runs
    - Implement basic report generation for detected issues

3. **Proof of Concept Implementation**
    - Run Maestro tests to generate reference screenshots
    - Process screenshots with prototype AI analysis tool
    - Intentionally introduce UI changes to test detection capabilities
    - Document detection capabilities and limitations

4. **Evaluation and Recommendations**
    - Assess effectiveness of AI analysis approach
    - Document findings, including false positives/negatives
    - Create recommendations for production implementation
    - Present spike results to the team

## Acceptance Criteria

- Working prototype script that can analyze Maestro screenshots
- Documentation of approach, including selected AI tools/services
- Sample analysis report from test run showing detected issues
- Presentation of findings with clear recommendations for next steps
- Decision on whether to proceed with full implementation

## Technical Details

The spike should focus on:

- Integrating with AI image analysis services/libraries
- Processing Maestro screenshot directories
- Detecting common UI issues:
    - Text overlap/truncation
    - Element misalignment
    - Color contrast problems
    - Missing UI elements
    - Inconsistent spacing
- Generating useful, actionable reports

## Dependencies

- Maestro test suite with screenshots generation
- Access to AI services for image analysis (may require API keys)
- Sample app builds with both correct and intentionally flawed UIs for testing

## Story Points

8 points (1-2 weeks of work)

## AI Assistance Analysis

### Claude 3.7 Sonnet

- **LOE with Firebender**: 9/10 (Excellent for researching AI services and documentation)
- **Likelihood of Success**: 7/10 (Experimental nature introduces some uncertainty)
- **Likelihood of Frustration**: 5/10 (May require iteration to find optimal approach)
- **Likelihood of Manual Steps**: 7/10 (Integration with AI services requires manual setup)
- **Estimated Hours**: 16-24 hours

### Gemini 2.5 Pro

- **LOE with Firebender**: 8/10 (Good for code generation and integration examples)
- **Likelihood of Success**: 7/10 (Similar likelihood of successful outcomes)
- **Likelihood of Frustration**: 6/10 (May require more specific prompting)
- **Likelihood of Manual Steps**: 7/10 (Similar manual setup requirements)
- **Estimated Hours**: 18-26 hours

## Simplest Bare Minimum Test Cases

- Script should correctly identify a missing UI element in test screenshots
- Script should detect text that is truncated or overlapping
- Script should identify significant color/contrast issues
- Analysis should provide clear reports that point to specific issues
- False positive rate should be documented and below acceptable threshold
