# Story: Implement Billing Tab with Flutter-to-Kotlin Navigation

## Summary (TLDR)

**Create a Flutter-based Billing tab that navigates to a native Kotlin detail page.**

* **Key Features**:
    * Billing tab directly shows Flutter bill list (no intermediate button)
   * Navigation from Flutter view to **Kotlin detail page**
  * **Deep linking** support for direct access to bill details (stretch goal)
* **Technical Focus**:
   * Flutter â†’ Kotlin navigation with proper backstack handling
   * State preservation when returning to Flutter list
* **Time Estimate**: 10-12 hours

## Description

Implement the "Billing" tab to directly show a Flutter bills list with navigation to a Kotlin detail
page, demonstrating
Flutter-to-Kotlin navigation with proper UX flow.

## Requirements

- Billing tab directly displays Flutter bills list (no intermediate navigation)
- Create navigation to a Kotlin Item Detail Page for a bill
- Implement deep linking capabilities to the bill detail page (stretch goal)
- Configure proper backstack behavior when navigating between Flutter and Kotlin

## Technical Tasks

- [ ] Modify Billing tab to directly launch Flutter bills view
- [ ] Implement list of bills with selectable items in Flutter
- [ ] Create Kotlin bill detail page
- [ ] Implement navigation from Flutter billing list to Kotlin bill detail
- [ ] Set up deep link handling for direct navigation to bill detail (stretch goal)
- [ ] Configure proper backstack behavior when returning from bill detail
- [ ] Add appropriate transition animations between views
- [ ] Implement state preservation when returning to billing list

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Billing tab directly displays Flutter bills list (no extra button press)
- [ ] Selecting a bill navigates to a Kotlin detail view
- [ ] Deep links correctly navigate directly to bill detail page (stretch goal)
- [ ] Back button works correctly when navigating from bill detail to billing list
- [ ] State is preserved when navigating back to billing list
- [ ] No visual glitches during transitions

## Dependencies

- Story 1: Setup Base Hybrid App Infrastructure

## Notes

This story demonstrates Flutter-to-Kotlin navigation with a clean UX flow. The Billing tab should
directly show
the Flutter bills list without requiring intermediate navigation steps. Special attention should be
paid to
handling the backstack correctly when navigating from Flutter to Kotlin and back.

## AI Analysis

### Development Assistance Metrics

- **LOE with Firebender using Claude Sonnet 3.7:** High
- **LOE with Firebender using Gemini 2.5 Pro:** Medium-High

### Project Metrics (Scale 1-10)

- **Likelihood of Success:** 8/10
- **Likelihood of Frustration:** 6/10
- **Likelihood of Manual Steps:** 8/10

### Time Estimate

- **Estimated Hours:** 10-12 hours

### Notes

This story presents several complex challenges:

1. Implementing direct Flutter view integration in the Billing tab
2. Navigation from Flutter to Kotlin views requires custom platform channel implementation
3. Deep linking support requires careful coordination between Android's intent system and Flutter's
   navigation (stretch goal)
4. Preserving state when navigating back to Flutter from Kotlin requires special attention

The key UX improvement is making the Billing tab directly show the Flutter bills list, eliminating
unnecessary
navigation steps and providing a smoother user experience.
