# Before Commit Concept - DITL Implementation

## Purpose

The `before_commit.md` file serves as a safety mechanism to prevent accidental commits of temporary,
experimental, or sensitive content during AI-assisted development sessions.

## How It Works

### Warning System

- ⚠️ **Yellow warning icons** at the beginning and end of DITL files
- **before_commit.md** file in project root serves as checklist
- Clear visual indicators to remind developers to review before committing

### Content Categories to Review

#### Temporary/Experimental Code

- Animated demonstrations (like the red blinking Flutter text)
- Debug logging or verbose output
- Placeholder implementations
- Test-specific configurations

#### Sensitive Information

- Internal discussions or observations
- Personal notes or brainstorming
- Company-specific references
- Unpolished ideas

#### Quality Control

- Ensure documentation is professional and complete
- Verify code is production-ready
- Check that examples are appropriate for public viewing

## Automation Ideas

### Git Pre-commit Hook Implementation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Check if before_commit.md has content beyond headers
if [ -f "before_commit.md" ]; then
    # Count non-empty, non-header lines
    CONTENT_LINES=$(grep -v '^#' before_commit.md | grep -v '^$' | grep -v '^-.*\[ \]' | wc -l)
    
    if [ $CONTENT_LINES -gt 0 ]; then
        echo "❌ COMMIT BLOCKED: before_commit.md contains pending items"
        echo "Please review and clear before_commit.md before committing"
        echo ""
        echo "Current items:"
        grep -v '^#' before_commit.md | grep -v '^$'
        exit 1
    fi
fi

# Check for [OMIT] markers in files
if grep -r "\[OMIT\]" --exclude-dir=temporary_files --exclude-dir=.git .; then
    echo "❌ COMMIT BLOCKED: Found [OMIT] markers in tracked files"
    echo "Please remove or handle omitted content before committing"
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Pre-commit checks passed"
```

### Setup Instructions

```bash
# Make pre-commit hook executable
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Test the hook
git add . && git commit -m "test commit"
```

### IDE Integration Ideas

- VS Code extension to highlight before_commit.md when it has content
- IntelliJ plugin to show warning icons in project explorer
- Git GUI integration to show warnings before commits

## Workflow Integration

### During Development

1. AI adds items to `before_commit.md` as needed
2. Developer sees visual warnings in DITL files
3. Temporary/experimental code gets flagged automatically

### Before Committing

1. Review `before_commit.md` checklist
2. Clean up flagged items (remove animations, review content)
3. Clear checklist items as completed
4. Only commit when before_commit.md is clean

### Team Usage

- Shared understanding of what needs review
- Consistent process across team members
- Automated enforcement through git hooks

## Benefits

### Prevents Accidental Commits

- No more embarrassing temporary code in production repos
- Catches sensitive information before it goes public
- Ensures professional quality in committed code

### Maintains Development Velocity

- Allows experimental/temporary code during development
- Doesn't slow down AI-assisted rapid prototyping
- Separates "development mode" from "commit mode"

### Quality Assurance

- Built-in review process for AI-generated content
- Human oversight of automated decisions
- Professional presentation in public repositories

## Refinement Ideas

### Enhanced Automation

- Automatic detection of demo/test code patterns
- Integration with linting tools
- Smart categorization of content types

### Better User Experience

- Visual indicators in development environment
- Browser notifications when before_commit.md has content
- Integration with development workflow tools

### Team Collaboration

- Shared templates for common review categories
- Team-specific rules and patterns
- Integration with PR review processes

## Success Metrics

- **Zero accidental commits** of temporary/demo code
- **Improved code quality** in public repositories
- **Maintained development velocity** during AI-assisted sessions
- **Team adoption** and consistent usage
