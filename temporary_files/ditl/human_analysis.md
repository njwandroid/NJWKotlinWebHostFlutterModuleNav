# Human Analysis of DITL Implementation

This is incredible so far that it includes ongoing green checkmarks and red x failures with graphic
easy to spot icons and yellow warning icons and observations on what is ongoing etc. So far this
appears to be a wild success. Obviously quality needs to be confirmed, but it feels extremely likely
that my velocity is way higher than without AI and the amount of things I was able to do both in
depth and breadth appears to be way higher than without AI.

The pending question is to verify the previous consensus which is 'Multitasking is mostly a scam'.
It's hard to believe that agentic AI changes it but it feels like a possibility that it's worth a
blog post.
