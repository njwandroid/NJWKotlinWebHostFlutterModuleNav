================================================================================

**CONTEXT**: 
I'm working on a Flutter module integration into an Android host application. The Android app builds and installs successfully, but the Flutter module is not launching properly when the "TF" button is tapped. 

**CURRENT STATE**:
- Android host app: Jetpack Compose app with bottom navigation and "TF" button in TopAppBar
- Flutter module: Located at ../njw_flutter_navigation_demo/ with animated "THIS IS IN FLUTTER" text
- Build status: SUCCESS - app installs on device 48050DLAQ0091E (Pixel 9)
- Issue: TF button doesn't launch Flutter screen - Maestro test fails on Flutter assertion

**KEY FINDING - CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**:
üö® **AndroidManifest.xml is missing FlutterActivity registration!** 
The current manifest only has MainActivity but NO FlutterActivity entry. This is why FlutterActivity.createDefaultIntent(context) fails silently.

**FILES INVOLVED**:
- MainActivity.kt: Contains TF button with FlutterActivity.createDefaultIntent(context) + logging
- ../njw_flutter_navigation_demo/lib/main.dart: Flutter module with animated demo content  
- maestro/flows/flutter_hello_world.yaml: Test that verifies Flutter integration
- AndroidManifest.xml: **MISSING FlutterActivity registration** (root cause)

**PROBLEM DIAGNOSIS**:
The Maestro test sequence:
1. ‚úÖ Launches Android app successfully  
2. ‚úÖ Taps "TF" button successfully (logging confirms button pressed)
3. ‚ùå Cannot find "THIS IS IN FLUTTER" text (Flutter screen never appears)
4. ‚ùå Cannot find "Flutter View" text (Flutter activity never launches)

**ROOT CAUSE**: 
FlutterActivity is not registered in AndroidManifest.xml, so the Intent fails silently without any visible error to the user.

**DEBUGGING DONE**:
- Added comprehensive logging to MainActivity TF button click handler
- Verified app builds and installs without errors  
- Simple hello_world.yaml test passes (app launches fine)
- Flutter module has correct animated content
- ‚úÖ **IDENTIFIED: AndroidManifest.xml missing FlutterActivity entry**

**TECHNICAL DETAILS**:
- Package: com.neiljaywarner.myflutternavbarapplication
- Flutter module: njw_flutter_navigation_demo 
- Device: 48050DLAQ0091E (Pixel 9 - Android 15)
- Build tool: ./gradlew installDebug (works)
- Test tool: maestro test (hello_world passes, flutter_hello_world fails)

**IMMEDIATE FIX NEEDED**:
Add FlutterActivity to AndroidManifest.xml:
```xml
<activity
    android:name="io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity"
    android:exported="false"
    android:launchMode="singleTop"
    android:theme="@style/LaunchTheme" />
```

**WHAT I NEED**:
1. Fix AndroidManifest.xml to register FlutterActivity properly
2. Verify Flutter screen launches when TF button is pressed
3. Confirm animated "THIS IS IN FLUTTER" text is visible on device
4. Ensure Maestro test passes with Flutter assertions

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
- TF button launches Flutter screen with animated red "THIS IS IN FLUTTER" text
- User can navigate back to Android app 
- Maestro test maestro/flows/flutter_hello_world.yaml passes completely
- Manual verification on physical device confirms integration works

**REFERENCE**:
Previous working implementation: https://github.com/njwandroid/NJWKotlinWebHostFlutterModuleNav/pull/6
AI interactions log has detailed troubleshooting history in 5_ai_interactions_log.md

**URGENT**: Focus on AndroidManifest.xml fix first - this is likely the complete solution to the problem.
