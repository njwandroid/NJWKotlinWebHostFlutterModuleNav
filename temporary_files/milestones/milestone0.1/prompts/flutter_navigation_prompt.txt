I need to set up basic Flutter navigation scaffolding for my app in the next 25 minutes. This will serve as the foundation for more complex navigation patterns I'll implement tomorrow.

Please help me with the following:

1. Set up a basic MaterialApp with named routes.
2. Create 3 simple placeholder screens:
   - HomeScreen: The main landing screen
   - NativeDemoScreen: A screen that will later demonstrate calling native code
   - DeepLinkTargetScreen: A screen that will be the target of deep links

3. Each screen should:
   - Have a distinct AppBar title
   - Display some text indicating which screen it is
   - Have navigation buttons to the other screens
   - Follow best practices for Flutter navigation

4. Implement the named routes system in the MaterialApp for navigation between these screens.

I need clean, straightforward code that follows Flutter best practices and will serve as a good foundation for tomorrow's more advanced navigation tasks (deep linking, native-Flutter navigation, etc.).
