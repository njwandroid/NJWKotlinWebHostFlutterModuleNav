I need to set up the Kotlin side of a JNIgen demo for my Flutter app. I have about 30 minutes to create a simple Kotlin API function that will later be called from Flutter using JNIgen.

Please help me with the following:

1. Create a simple Kotlin file that contains a basic function to demonstrate JNIgen integration. 
2. The function should be something simple like a greeting function: `fun greet(name: String): String { return "Hello, $name from Kotlin!" }` 
3. Include any necessary annotations or setup required by JNIgen.
4. Add proper documentation comments to the function.
5. Explain where in the Android project structure this file should be placed.
6. Mention any configurations or dependencies I might need to ensure JNIgen works properly.

I want this to be a very clean, simple example that will work reliably for a demo. The focus is on getting the Kotlin side correctly set up in this 30-minute window. Tomorrow I'll handle the Dart/Flutter side of the integration.
