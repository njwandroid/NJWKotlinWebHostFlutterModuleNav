# ISSUE 1: Maestro Hello World - Flutter, Android, and Web

## Description

Create a comprehensive Maestro test suite that demonstrates the capability to test across Flutter,
native Android, and web platforms. This will serve as a foundation for our cross-platform testing
strategy and provide immediate validation of basic functionality across all platforms.

## Time Allocation

- 40 minutes

## Objectives

- Create a Maestro test flow that works across Flutter, Android native, and web platforms
- Demonstrate the ability to verify UI elements on each platform
- Capture screenshots as evidence of successful execution on each platform
- Document the basic Maestro setup process for cross-platform testing

## Tasks

1. Set up basic Flutter "Hello World" application with native Android elements (10 min)
2. Create Maestro flow for Flutter UI validation (10 min)
    - Launch app
    - Verify Flutter UI elements
    - Capture screenshot
3. Extend test to validate native Android elements (10 min)
    - Test interaction with native Android component
    - Verify Android-specific UI elements
    - Capture screenshot
4. Create additional test flow for web platform (10 min)
    - Configure for web testing
    - Verify web-specific rendering
    - Capture screenshot

## Deliverables

- Basic Flutter application with native Android elements
- Maestro test flows for all three platforms
- Screenshots demonstrating successful test execution on each platform
- Pull request with implementation and documentation

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Maestro successfully tests Flutter UI components
2. Maestro successfully tests native Android components
3. Maestro successfully tests web-rendered components
4. Tests include appropriate assertions for each platform
5. Screenshots document successful execution across platforms
6. PR includes documentation for running tests on all platforms

## Dependencies

- Maestro CLI installed on development machine
- Flutter development environment configured for Android and web
