# ISSUE 4: Deep Links & Web Preview

## Description

Implement Android deep link functionality to directly navigate to specific Flutter screens and get
the app running on the web platform to test basic navigation in a browser environment.

## Time Allocation

- 60 minutes

## Objectives

- Implement a simple deep link in Android that navigates to a Flutter screen
- Run the Flutter app on the web platform
- Test navigation patterns on both platforms
- Document any platform-specific differences

## Tasks

1. Implement Android deep link (30 min)
    - Configure AndroidManifest.xml for deep link handling
    - Implement code to handle a custom scheme (e.g., `myapp://deeplink`)
    - Create logic to navigate to the DeepLinkTargetScreen in Flutter
    - Test the deep link using adb or a test app

2. Flutter Web configuration and testing (20 min)
    - Configure the app for web support if not already done
    - Build and run the app on web
    - Test basic navigation between Flutter screens on web
    - Document any differences in behavior compared to mobile

3. Test backstack with deep links and web navigation (10 min)
    - Verify proper back button handling for deep links
    - Check history navigation in web
    - Document any issues or platform differences

## Deliverables

- Working deep link implementation for Android
- Flutter app running on web platform
- Documentation of implementation details and platform differences
- Test results for navigation flows on both platforms

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Deep link successfully navigates to the target Flutter screen
2. Flutter app runs correctly on web browser
3. Navigation between screens works on web platform
4. Backstack behavior is documented for both platforms
5. Implementation follows best practices for both Android and web

## Dependencies

- Completion of issues #1, #2, and #3
- Android emulator or device for testing deep links
- Web browser for testing Flutter web
