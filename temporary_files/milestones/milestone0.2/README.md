# Milestone 0.2: Day 2 - 5 Hour Implementation

This milestone represents the remaining 5 hours of the timeboxed demo plan, focusing on implementing
advanced navigation features, deep linking, and cross-platform integration building on the
foundation created in milestone0.1.

## Time Allocation
- Total time: 5 hours
- Working time: ~210 minutes
- Break time: ~90 minutes (including lunch)

## Key Objectives

1. Implement bidirectional navigation between Android native code and Flutter
2. Set up deep links and web platform support
3. Complete JNIgen integration with Dart bindings
4. Review, polish, and document all minimum viable demos (MVDs)
