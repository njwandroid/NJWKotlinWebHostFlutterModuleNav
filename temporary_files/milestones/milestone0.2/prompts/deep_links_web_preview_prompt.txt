I need to implement Android deep links and get my Flutter app running on web within 60 minutes. Yesterday, I created a Flutter app with basic navigation and screens (HomeScreen, NativeDemoScreen, DeepLinkTargetScreen).

Please help me with the following:

1. Implement Android deep linking:
   - Configure AndroidManifest.xml to handle a custom scheme (e.g., `myapp://deeplink`)
   - Set up code to extract parameters from deep links (if applicable)
   - Navigate to the DeepLinkTargetScreen when a deep link is activated
   - Include instructions for testing with adb or another method

2. Configure and run the app on web:
   - Explain any web-specific configuration needed
   - Guide me through building and running the app on web
   - Note any adjustments needed for web navigation to work properly
   - Highlight key differences between mobile and web navigation

3. Test backstack behavior:
   - How to properly handle back navigation with deep links
   - Web-specific considerations for history navigation
   - Best practices for consistent behavior across platforms

Please provide complete code samples and configuration instructions. The goal is to demonstrate deep linking on Android and have the app running on web with proper navigation within this 60-minute timeframe.
