I've completed the implementation of three Minimum Viable Demos (MVDs) for my Flutter project:

1. Maestro testing: A simple test that verifies my app launches and displays certain elements
2. Navigation: Android <-> Flutter navigation, deep links, and web navigation
3. JNIgen: Kotlin function being called from Flutter UI

I now have 40 minutes to review, polish, and document these MVDs. Please help me with:

1. A structured plan to quickly verify all three MVDs are working correctly:
   - What should I check for each MVD?
   - Any quick tests I can run to validate functionality?
   - Common issues to look for?

2. Help me create a "Future Polish & Content Blueprint" for each MVD with sections for:
   - **Elevating to "Excellent" Demo:** Ideas to improve the implementation
   - **Blog Post/Training Material Ideas:** Topics worth exploring in depth
   - **Code Refinements/Tech Debt:** Areas that could be improved
   - **Open Questions/Explorations Deferred:** Things to explore later

3. Suggest key talking points for a demo of each MVD:
   - What aspects should I highlight?
   - Any impressive technical details worth mentioning?
   - How to present a coherent story across the three demos?

The goal is to have a solid foundation for future development and documentation while ensuring the current implementations are functioning correctly.
