I need to complete my JNIgen integration within the next 40 minutes. Yesterday, I created the Kotlin side with a simple function:

```kotlin
/**
 * A simple greeting function to demonstrate JNIgen.
 *
 * @param name The name to greet
 * @return A greeting message from Kotlin
 */
fun greet(name: String): String {
    return "Hello, $name from Kotlin!"
}
```

Now I need to:

1. Generate the Dart bindings for this Kotlin function using JNIgen:
   - Provide the exact commands to run
   - Explain what the generated files are and where they should go
   - Address any common errors or issues that might occur

2. Integrate these bindings into my Flutter app:
   - Import the necessary files
   - Create a UI element (button) on the HomeScreen that calls this function
   - Display the result in a Text widget
   - Handle potential errors properly

3. Test the integration:
   - How to verify it's working end-to-end
   - Troubleshooting tips if the call fails

Please provide complete code samples and instructions for both the binding generation and Flutter implementation. The goal is to have a working demo where I can press a button in my Flutter app and see the result from the Kotlin function.
