# Developer Experience Guide for Hybrid App Development

## Optimizing Your Development Workflow with Multiple Monitors

### Dual Monitor Setup Recommendations

#### Monitor 1 (Primary)

- **IDE/Code Editor**: Keep your primary development environment here
- **Terminal/Console**: Position at the bottom for quick command execution
- **Debugging Tools**: Attach to the side of your IDE when active

#### Monitor 2 (Secondary)

- **Documentation**: Keep relevant Flutter/Native docs open
- **App Previews**: Run simulators/emulators here
- **GitHub/Issue Tracking**: Keep tickets visible while coding
- **Figma/UI Designs**: Reference designs while implementing UI

### Multi-Monitor Workflow Tips

1. **Context Switching Reduction**:
    - Keep implementation code on Monitor 1
    - Keep reference materials (docs, designs, tickets) on Monitor 2
    - Avoid constantly switching between applications on the same monitor

2. **Window Management**:
    - Use window snapping tools (Rectangle for macOS, Windows built-in)
    - Create consistent workspace layouts for different development tasks
    - Save window arrangements for different development contexts (coding, testing, debugging)

3. **Cross-Platform Testing**:
    - Run iOS Simulator and Android Emulator side-by-side on Monitor 2
    - Use split views to compare behavior across platforms

## Developer in the Loop (DITL) Workflow

Developer in the Loop (DITL) is an interactive development style where you maintain tight feedback
cycles with AI assistance while retaining control over implementation decisions.

### DITL Best Practices

1. **Break Down Tasks**:
    - Divide work into small, focused segments
    - Have AI suggest approaches before implementation
    - Review and refine AI recommendations before applying

2. **Maintain Control Points**:
    - Always review generated code before committing
    - Establish checkpoints where you validate AI's understanding
    - Explicitly define what aspects AI should/shouldn't modify

3. **Effective Prompt Strategies**:
    - Start with high-level architecture discussions
    - Progressively refine implementation details
    - Use incremental prompts that build on previous context

4. **Review Cycle**:
    - After each AI suggestion, critically evaluate the implementation
    - Test early and often, especially for cross-platform behavior
    - Maintain a "trust but verify" approach to AI-generated code

### DITL for Hybrid App Development

#### Planning Phase

1. Have AI recommend overall architecture and integration points
2. Review and adjust based on your knowledge of platform specifics
3. Finalize the architecture with your modifications

#### Implementation Phase

1. Let AI generate initial code for each component
2. Review platform-specific implementations carefully
3. Test each component individually before integration
4. Have AI suggest optimizations after your initial review

#### Testing Phase

1. Create test cases based on AI suggestions but add edge cases
2. Run tests on both platforms simultaneously (dual monitor advantage)
3. Have AI help analyze and fix platform-specific issues

## Progress Tracking Tips

1. **Visual Progress Board**:
    - Keep a Kanban-style board visible on secondary monitor
    - Move tickets through stages as you complete them
    - Color-code tickets by platform (Android/iOS/Flutter)

2. **Time Boxing**:
    - Allocate specific time blocks for different aspects of development
    - Switch contexts at predetermined intervals to maintain focus
    - Schedule dedicated review periods for AI-generated code

3. **Documentation as You Go**:
    - Document platform-specific quirks immediately when discovered
    - Have AI help generate documentation based on your implementation
    - Keep a running log of key decisions and why they were made

## Tools That Enhance DITL Workflow

1. **Screen Recording**:
    - Record challenging implementation sessions for later review
    - Share recordings with AI to get insights on improvement

2. **Shared Clipboard Managers**:
    - Use tools that maintain clipboard history across monitors
    - Create snippets for frequently used platform-specific code

3. **Window Management Tools**:
    - Rectangle (macOS)
    - PowerToys (Windows)
    - i3 (Linux)

4. **Notification Management**:
    - Disable non-essential notifications during focused work
    - Schedule specific times to check emails/messages

Remember that the most effective DITL workflow is one that you customize to your specific
preferences and development style. Experiment with different approaches and refine your process over
time.
