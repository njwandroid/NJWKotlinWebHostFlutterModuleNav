[2024-07-26 10:00:00] USER: please keep the ai interactions log file up to date, make a plan directory and an md file to estimate how many hours and how much frustration we think we could save by using LLMs and firebender effectively, both in terms of percentage and hours  for entire project and per epic and for the first three stories.   Then review the entire plan in a gemini_analysis md file with comments, questions, concerns, good bad and ugly
AI: Okay, I can help with that. It looks like an `ai_interactions.log` file doesn't exist yet. I'll create one and then proceed with the rest of your request. I will perform the following steps: 1. Create an `ai_interactions.log` file. 2. Create a `plan` directory. 3. Create an MD file in the `plan` directory to estimate time and frustration savings. 4. Create a `gemini_analysis.md` file in the `plan` directory to review the plan. Is there any specific content you'd like me to add to the `ai_interactions.log` file, or should I just create an empty one for now?

[2024-07-26 10:05:00] USER: update with timestamps and these exact prompts an a summary of your responses
AI: Okay, I'll create the `ai_interactions.log` file and add the first interaction with a timestamp and a summary of my response. Then, I will create the `plan` directory and the two markdown files you requested within it: one for the time/frustration savings estimation and another for the Gemini analysis of the plan.
